    <h2>Rugby's Historical Roots in New Zealand</h2>
    
    <p>Rugby holds an unparalleled significance in New Zealand's cultural fabric, deeply intertwined with the nation's identity.

    The sport's growth was exponential, eventually becoming a national obsession. 
    The formation of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union (NZRFU) in 1892 marked the official establishment of rugby in the country, laying the foundation for its enduring legacy. 
    Since then, rugby has not only been a sport but a symbol of unity, pride, and passion for New Zealanders, transcending boundaries of ethnicity, class, and geography.</p>
