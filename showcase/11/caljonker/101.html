<h1> A 101 Guide to Looksmaxxing and Mewing </h1>

<main>

<h2> An Introduction to Looksmaxxing </h2>

<p> This guide will cover the basics of the most important aspects of the: body, skin, hair, clothes, and personality.<br>                   
    Before we begin, you need to know the two axioms in order to succeed at this earlier stage of looksmaxing:</p>

<p> When given the choice, put the minimum amount of effort (and money) you can, for maximum results. I know it sounds counter intuitive. <br>                                  
    It’s pretty tempting to lose yourself in the vast sea of information out there and start studying the color/season/kibbe theory, <br>
    while spending hundreds of dollars on expensive beauty products that you can’t use correctly, but now is not the time; if you do too much <br>
    too soon, the result is just going to be overwhelming and badly executed. Once you get the basics down for a few months, you can <br>
    pick an area you are interested in and work on that in more detail. Basically what I am saying is: if you can choose from being a 8/10 while <br>
    putting in 6/10 or being a 9/10 while putting in 10/10, go with the former (at least in the beginning).<br>
    Your hair/makeup/clothes should have the following three functions in this exact order of priority: NOT make you uglier, <br>
    HIDE your weak spots and THEN accentuate your good features. People usually believe that the last part is the most important, but they are wrong. <br>
    If you have nice lips but very yellow teeth, you should choose a lipstick primarily because it makes your teeth look whiter and then focus on showing off your lips. <br>
    Same with jewellery; It’s better not to wear any jewellery at all, rather than wearing stuff that makes you look uglier, it’s really that simple. </p>
    
<h3> BODY </h3>

<p> At this point of your looksmaxxing journey, the most important part is to be of a normal weight. <br>
    I know that BMI is not the perfect tool to assess that, but it’s more than enough for what you are doing now. Research shows that the most attractive BMI in women is around 19-21,<br>
    but if you are in the range of 18,5-24,5 you will be fine compared to the general population, since such a large number of women today are overweight.<br>
    You can achieve a normal body weight by not eating at a calorie surplus, you don’t even need to exercise at all, although obviously it is highly recommended <br>
    if you want to be healthy and also look more fit. But in order to have a normal body weight the number one priority by far should be monitoring your caloric intake, in a way that is sustainable to you.<br>
    There are many ways to do that, from actually counting the calories, to keto, to intuitive eating and many many more, so you need to find out what works the best for you. <br>
    If you see that, despite trying hard, you are not succeeding then it’s one of three things:<br>
    You are eating more / burning less calories than you are realizing, in which case you need to measure diligently everything and adjust accordingly.<br>
    You have a health problem such as theroid or PCOS, which is making it more difficult to lose. In that case you will need to see a doctor and go from there. <br>
    You will still be able to lose weight, although it will be harder, but keep in mind that reaching a normal weight will also benefit your condition and overall health.<br>
    Your relationship with food is not healthy, meaning you suffer from food addiction, binge eating disorder, or generally you turn to food for comfort etc. <br>
    I think this is probably the most common of all and the trickiest one to solve. There are many ways to work through this, from seeing a therapist to reading books, <br>
    journaling, joining groups and many many more, but if you don’t know where to begin I have two pieces of advice: I shed the “all or nothing” mentality - it’s not either you <br>
    eat only salads and exercise or you eat pizza AND ice cream AND cookies while sitting on the couch, <br>
    II give yourself TIME and opt for a healthy loss of 1-2 pounds per week maximum - there is no point in losing 10 pounds<br>
     in a week only to gain them back in the next month, which IS what will happen if your plan is unsustainably strict. </p>
    
<h3> SKIN </h3>
    
    <img src="\\internal.pakuranga.school.nz\users\home\students\caljonker\Downloads\200.gif" alt=scenery>

<p> Having clear skin is obviously important when it comes to looking conventionally attractive. Basically, <br>
    a gentle cleanser twice a day, moisturiser and sunscreen daily and exfoliating weekly depending on your skin’s type. Once you got that down you can start reading on vitamin C serums, <br>
    retinoids etc but personally I wouldn’t introduce any of that to my routine without the help of a professional.<br>
    If you don’t see results there is no reason to waste time and money on expensive products and facials, go see a reputable dermatologist as soon as you can. <br>
    They will find the root of your problem and address it with the right creams/pills that is tailored towards you. Usually you will be advised to take antibiotics, <br>
    accutane, spirolactone, or birth control depending on the issue, but you need a doctor to evaluate which one you need.<br>
    Most facials are glamorised moisturising masks honestly, so if you are interested in investing in something that could help your skin become clearer, I would only recommend either a professional cleansing with microcrystalls<br>
    and extractions or a chemical peel if your dermatologist thinks it would help you.<br>
    As far as the skin on body is concerned, if you don’t have any specific problems such as eczema or body acne, there is no need for a complicated routine. Exfoliate once or twice a week in the shower and apply some body lotion <br>
    (recommend cerave or Brazilian bum bum) after every shower to keep your skin smooth and moisturised. The gentle massage will reduce the appearance of cellulite for a while, <br>
    but there are no magic creams to make it disappear and that’s honestly not a huge deal. <br>
    Drinking enough water and exercising can also minimise the appearance of cellulite. </p>
    
<h3> HAIR </h3>

    <img src="\\internal.pakuranga.school.nz\users\home\students\caljonker\Downloads\mog-mogged.gif" alt=scenery>

<p> If you are not interested in catering towards some very specific niche, then your hair is probably going to look better long.<br>
    However, the harsh truth is that having stringy and damaged hair that is very long will probably look worse than healthy, shiny hair that goes a little below your shoulders. <br>
    So, at this point, you better keep it as long as possible while still being healthy and go for small trims regularly (at least once every 2-3 months).<br>
    I don’t think there is a point in giving specific advice, because depending on your hair type, your hair care routine will be very different but there are a couple of subs you can check:<br>
    At this point I don’t think you need to be thinking about dying your hair or doing any high maintenance haircuts. Just keeping it relatively long and <br>
    healthy while trying out a few hairstyles when you have time is more than enough, if you are a beginner to looksmaxing.<br>
    No matter what your hair type is, I would recommend getting a microfiber turban and/or a good ionic hair dryer with ceramic technology. <br>
    Both are better options than using a random towel/hairdryer or letting your hair air dry completely. Remember that your hair is at its most vulnerable state while wet.<br>
    Something I am just going to mention briefly here is brows. Even if you think you are decent at shaping your brows, <br>
    I would advise you to go to a professional first, at least once. After the professional shapes your brows, you can then maintain them yourself, if you want to save money. </p>
    
<h3> CLOTHES </h3>

<img src="\\internal.pakuranga.school.nz\users\home\students\caljonker\Downloads\putin-putin-meme.gif" alt=scenery>
    
<p> Building the wardrobe of your dreams can be intimidating at first. During your journey towards your ideal aesthetic, you will probably experience some fails. It’s ok.
    General pointers:<br>
    
    <p> - The number one thing you should be focusing on is the fit. No matter how cute something looks in the hanger, it will make you look worse if it doesn’t fit you right. </p>
    
    <p> - I know how tempting it is to buy clothes online but if you want a good fit, you better go to the store yourself and try the clothes on.</p>
    
    <p> - Start with good quality underwear that fit you well. You don’t need a lot, just a nude and a black bra and some panties that don’t distort your shape. <br>
    Some people recommend aerie, but at least in my country they are pretty flimsy and don’t have a good size range. On the other hand, you can find some pretty decent clothes at AE.</p>
    
    <p> - You don’t need statement pieces at this stage, they are probably going to make you look worse. 
    Go for simple clothes in inoffensive colors such as black, white and navy blue that can be easily combined with each other. <br>
    If you want reasonably priced professional clothes of decent quality, I definitely recommend marks and spencer.</p>
    
    <p> - As far as shoes go, here is what you will only need for 90% of the occasions: ankle boots (black or brown), a pair of trainers (black or white), <br>
    a pair of neutral coloured sandals and a pair of black comfy black heels. If you have all that, forget the shoes and focus on covering the rest of your wardrobe first before buying more shoes.</p>
    
    <p> - If you are not a size 0-2, avoid shein and similar websites, the clothes won’t fit as you hope 99% of the time. 
    Go to physical stores and try clothes on.</p>
    
    <p> - To build a good wardrobe you will to invest time. In order to avoid too many bad purchases (which are bound to happen), 
    a good idea is to go to the mall once a week for a month, trying and seeing clothes but not buying anything. <br>
    After a while you will have a feel for what you should be getting. </p>
    
<h3> PERSONALITY </h3>
    
<p> I might have left it for last, but the truth is that this is the most crucial part in your journey. If you don’t work on that, then most of what I said above is pointless. <br>
    Obviously if you have serious mental health issues you should seek therapy (and even if you don’t it can be useful), so I am not going to expand on that.<br>
    But bear in mind that: Women, younger women even more so, tend to have a lower self esteem. That can make you very vulnerable for exploitation, even by the most well meaning people. <br>
    Unfortunately, when we meet someone, we are taught to worry about wether they like us or not, instead of focusing of wether we even like them first. The need of approval can be strong, but it is possible to work through it.<br>
    Right down your boundaries and the reasons why you have them and then right down the ways you will be defending them. Read them regularly. </p>
