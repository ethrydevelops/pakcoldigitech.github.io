<h1> The Art of Mewing </h1>

<main>

<h2> An Introduction to Mewing </h2>

<p> Mewing is a technique of adjusting your tongue posture to its right position. <br>
It can improve your jawline and overall face structure while helping with jaw pain, <br>
sleep apnea, crooked teeth, and other health conditions. <br>
Mewing can be applied as a natural, cosmetic correction to improve overall jaw posture.<br>
But as with all workouts, mewing exercises take conscious effort at first.<br>
You must follow a workout plan and a daily routine to adjust your tongue placement. <br>
Achieving the correct tongue resting position unconsciously can strengthen your jawline <br>
and improve the symmetry of your facial structure.</p>

<h2> Why you should start Mewing </h2>

<p>The reasons to start practicing mewing are best explained visually. That’s why we gathered some real-life photos of men, women, <br>
girls, and boys who solved their medical concerns and gained some cosmetic benefits from the way mewing works.</p>

<h3> Jaw and Jawline </h3>

<p> What’s not visible in the photos is that improving your jawline posture can also reduce jaw-related pain. </p>

<h3> Double Chin </h3>

<p> The cosmetic benefits of resting your tongue on the roof of your mouth don’t stop at giving you a stronger jawline. <br>
Mewing is proven to help reduce double chin.</p>

<h3> Receading Chin </h3>

<p> Double chins, receding chins, and overall weak chins arise from an underdeveloped lower jaw. <br>
Mewing is a jaw surgery-free solution for these conditions. </p>

<h3> Cheekbones </h3>

<p> Cheekbone shape is closely related to every other part of the body. 
So, mewing exercises can also help with cheekbone development. </p>

<h3> Eyes </h3>

<p> Proper mewing technique moves your midface up slightly. <br>
Over time this can result in deeper-set eyes, hooded brows and altered eye tilt. <br>
However, mewing has the least impact on the eyes and only some practitioners report changes.</p>

<h3> Hunter Eyes</h3>

<p> Deemed aesthetically appealing by many, <br>
hunter’s eyes are one of the last things you will develop from stronger facial muscles. <br>
Although, children who practice mewing might see some impact early on.</p>

<h3> Nose </h3>

<p> Mewing is also making waves as a less intrusive nose treatment. <br>
It can help fix crooked noses, make noses smaller, and in some cases, even reshape them completely! </p>

<h3> Lip </h3>

<p> Mewing is a thing to try before surgery for those wanting to enhance their lips. <br>
It’s non-intrusive and can be done for free every day.</p>

<h3> Bimaxillary protrusion </h3>

<p> Many claim claim that mewing can be an alternative to surgery in the case of bimaxillary protrusion. <br>
It is characterized by protruding upper and lower teeth shape and placement.</p>

<h3> Face Asymmetry </h3>

<p> One of mewing’s core use cases is that it has an ability to improve one’s face symmetry, making you more attractive.</p>

<h3> Posture </h3>

<p> How you carry your head is essential to the posture of the whole body. <br>
Studies show that proper tongue alignment can have impact even on the knees!</p>
