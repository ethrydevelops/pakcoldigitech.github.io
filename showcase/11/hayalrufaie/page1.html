 Initially competing in local leagues, the team faced financial challenges early on, even teetering on the brink of extinction. However, through perseverance and the infusion of investment from a group of local businessmen, 
 the club was salvaged, rebranded as Manchester United in 1902, and steadily ascended to become one of the most successful and globally recognized football clubs, etching its name in the annals of football history with a legacy rich in triumphs, talent, and tradition.</p>
