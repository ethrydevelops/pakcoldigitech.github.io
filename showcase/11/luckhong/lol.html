        Part 1
        Prologue
        
        The ground rumbled. The once-isolated patches of sand cracked up in humour, as layers of the ground split apart around the Middle East, revealing a dark, deep hole. After a minute, the shaking reached its end. Emergency response team X, led by Captain Newton, arrived at the scene of the quake. Newton was average, although a bit too average. 30, unmarried, with slightly blond hair and black eyes, coupled with his average height, weight, and strength, makes him look like the ideal team captain.
        
          4.2, was the number Newton saw on the seismograph as it was measured by a fat-looking scientist. Around the area, buildings were either tilted or demolished from the quake. Newton ordered his men to rescue some civilians trapped underneath the destroyed buildings. He spun around just to notice a group of people surrounding an area. Calling it a group was an understatement, what he actually saw was a horde of people. He asked for his trustworthy vice-captain, Tim, to supervise the rescuers as he went to investigate the commotion.
        
        “Excuse me,” Newton said, as he passed through the crowd until he reached the front. He could not believe his eyes, a massive abyss opened up that seemed to reach the ends of the earth. The hole was unbelievably dark and stretched for as far as 500 metres. However, this made Newton a little suspicious. He remembers the seismograph he saw earlier. 4.2. This doesn’t seem like a hole to be caused by just a grade 4.2 earthquake. He snatched out his phone and snapped a picture, before turning back and walking out of the crowd through the sandy ground. Reporters and reporting helicopters rushed past him as he walked toward the vice-captain.
        
        “Everything done?” Newton asked.
        “All done captain, there should be no one left,” replied Tim. Tim was tall, but not skinny. With mud-like eyes, matching his chocolate hair. He is not very muscular but is quite strong from his experiences of rescuing. Newton called his team back to the jeep and drove off through the sandy plains back to the depths of the crowded city.
        
        Their headquarters are located beside the world's tallest building in the 21st century, the Burj Khalifa, making their base look dark and deserted. They got off the jeep and walked back into their lounge. Unlike the outside, the inside was very lively. Bright furniture and people’s chatter filled the building. The base commander welcomed Captain Newton and his team with a smile and some freshly baked cookies.
        
        “How’s the mission? Have a cookie.” the base commander exclaimed.
        “Everything went well, but there’s something you should see,” Newton replied in an unsure voice.
        “Come,” the base commander said in a serious manner, and Newton followed her into her office. The office was dark and grim, until the base commander flicked on the lights with her shiny fingers, coloured with pink glitter. She flung her long hair around and applied pressure on her table in a tilted posture.
        
        “What do you need to show me?” the base commander asked Captain Newton politely yet seriously. 
        “Look at this footage that I took, it doesn’t look like something caused by just a minor 4.2 magnitude earthquake, so I suspect that something is terribly off” Newton replied. The base commander looks confused. “Oh, about that, I saw a scientist’s seismograph and it read 4.2,” Newton explained quickly as he handed over his phone, which was displaying the image of the deep dark hole. She looked at it once, and just as she was about to return the phone, she took a moment’s glance just to be sure. She asked Captain Newton out of her room as she phoned the higher-ups about their discovery. Newton showed his team the image that he had taken in the afternoon, telling them to be on high alert as something else bad might happen in the following days. In his experience, he had never once seen such a large hole before, let alone at it only being such a small quake. He placed his worries aside and soon, it was nighttime. 
        
        The dark clouds moved continuously, just to leave behind a dark and isolated sky. There was not one star and the moon couldn’t be seen, surprisingly. Newton was looking out of his window, admiring the cloudy view. Once the clouds thinned, he turned to his bedside to look at his family photo, a young boy with a mother and father, just like any ideal family, as he slowly fell asleep.
        
        Ding! Ding! Ding!
        
        Newton got scared out of bed by the rapid sounds of the emergency bell. Something had gone terribly wrong. He stared out of the window by his bed. What used to be a nice isolated, dark blue sky now was turned into a red burning background as if the devil himself had made an appearance in their city. He rushed out to the main room to gather his crew, but to his surprise, the building was empty and quiet of all human activity. He took another look at the toilets, bedrooms, and kitchen, but it was all empty and isolated. He decides to go outside to investigate. Flames were dancing across buildings and trees, and people were eating each other. He wiped his eyes to see if the sight would disappear. Yet when he opened them all he could see was an ocean of zombies? More and more brainless humanoid creatures started moving towards the city, away from the direction of the hole. They are from underneath. Words cannot express the shock he felt as he powerlessly watched his team being consumed by these zombie-like creatures and turning into one of them. He took a small step back, just to trip over a leg, a green, gross, disgusting leg that seemed bloated and almost unlifelike. It wasn’t long before he realised that he made a massive blunder. 
        Chapter 1- Underneath
        
        “Breaking news! The zombie apocalypse predicted in the year 1886 has become a reality. Officials have decided to take countermeasures in regard to this and significantly increased our defence. Here is Commander Taylor giving out the press conference in regard to this situation.” The reporter spoke before the scene dissolved.
        
        Now on his TV was the renowned Commander Taylor. She swiftly tied up her overstretched hair before the darkness of her aquatic eye engulfed the camera. Her smooth yet pale skin indicated her young age, an age that caught the attention of many. Being a commander at such an early age was unheard of. She was the daughter of General Taylor, who was in charge of the underwater city destruction case along with Commander Chloe, being a field agent at that time with Corporal Norman. That case was the case that got them promoted.
        
        “Greetings, to everyone here. The zombie apocalypse was estimated to be first sighted in the United Arab Emirates, Middle East. These creatures had similar features as humans, but are grosser and greener.” Commander Taylor pulled out an image featuring one of the creatures. She took a breath and continued.
        
        “These creatures were supposed to be first drawn out from underneath in this really deep hole that stretches for an estimated length of about 500 meters across.” She pulls out another image to display in the slideshow. This time, it was a dark hole in the middle of a desert-covered city. 
        
        “Now folks, don’t you worry!” a sharply dressed guy popped into the screen and blocked her off the view. “We have tanks, guns and bombs. What do they have? There’s no way a bunch of death looking drunks are reaching our land from the other side of this bloody planet. They probably don’t even know how to swim!” He joked, but was only met by stone faces.
        
        “Anyways,” Commander Taylor continued, gently pushing the Corporal aside, “be cautious when you’re outside.” She spoke with a tone had no room for laughs, “this apocalypse is no joking matter, so if you spot any of these creatures, the-”
        
        And then the screen turned pitch black.
        
        “What a load of crap,” Steven yelped, his mud-like eyes reflecting off the darkness of the empty TV. With a push, he lifted himself off the cosy couch to turn off his TV  before going to eat breakfast as usual. He comforted himself on the chair and pulled a slice of bread out from the bag. Suddenly, something felt off for the young boy. His eyes bolted at the clock, where the long hand was at the six and the short one was between…
        
        GREAT NIGHTS OF COLOMBIA
        
        His heart pulse quickly started to have a rally with his ribs, already imagining what him and his laser eyes waiting for him in on the front door. In one quick motion, he carelessly slapped jam and peanut butter and took a quick bite out of it, before stuffing it into his lunchbox while uncoordinatedly dashing out the door.
        
        “Bye Mom, bye Dad!” Steven shouted to the back of the house as he slammed the door shut. As he took a quick breath outside, he turned to look forward to notice his best friend Jimmy, his feet flicking the ground impatiently, waiting for him.
        
        “Steven me boi,” Jimmy snapped his head at Steven, “10 minutes, 10 MINUTES BRO. You got some explaining to do.” ” Jimmy rambled. Jimmy was impatient, but nice. Had really short brownish-yellow hair, quite round, unlike Steven, who had black hair that just reached his eyebrows and was relatively short, but slightly muscular.
        “Ok, ok, here me out lad. Asian parents.” Steven lied, being the late waker he was. Jimmy just chuckles and rolls his eyes.
        “Oh, ok buddy, we all know what you were doing last night.” Jimmy responded and Steven’s cheeks burnt. They walked down the footpath on the way to school, as usual. But something caught Steven’s eye; some military jeeps and fully-armoured Humvees were jotting down the road. On a usual day, there are usually no death defying objects on Freelance Street. After a while of pondering, he turned away, thinking that it’s just the government increasing their countries’s military defence.
        
        They arrived at their high school five minutes later than usual, so most of the gang was already there. Sitting, chilling, and chatting at their usual spot underneath the grand, big tree in between their school’s art and English block. They approached Noah, about the same height as Steven, with black hair and black eyes. He carries around a cool toy lightsaber most of the time; for defence apparently against those goofy ahh bullies.
        
        “Hi, Noah!” Steven perked.
        “Ah! Evening children.” Noah chimed, leaning on his lightsaber, “5 minutes late eh?” he asked as he checked his watch.
        “Ok, look, we would have made it early if this BOZO didn’t ‘study his A Plus Plus’” he mimicked, throwing in some finger movements just for good touch.
        “SHUT UP BROWN SHEERAN” Steven shouted.
        
         As Steven turned towards the other three members of their friend group who were chatting about their classes and weekends; Liam, Charlotte, and Oliver. Liam is Indian, Charlotte is pure Andlese, like Noah,  and Oliver is British. All are slightly above average in height with black short hair and black eyes except for Charlotte, who had medium-length long blond hair and green emerald eyes.
        
        “Hello everyone.” Jimmy welcomed those three. They replied to him with a normal “Wassup” and “Hey!” and they went back to chatting. While all this was happening, Steven couldn’t help but notice the dark cloud that was slowly forming above the horizon. 
        “What are you looking at? An elephant up in the sky?” Elijah approached Steven with his athletic legs. Elijah was the group’s comedian, joker, loose cannon and proud unofficial leader and founder. Although it was a messy one he directed. Alongside him was Xander, smart, and nice but can be annoying at times. Imagine King Dede, but he is a human, then you got Xander.
        
        “Well, the sky is kinda dark today,” Steven replied in an uncertain tone.
        “It's fine.” Bob barges into the conversation with his signature “double thumbs up”. He slowly walked into the group from the otherside of the tree, his blond hair shimmering in the sudden flash of light. But as he got closer to them, the light of the sky slowly waves away in command of the clouds. Looking into Bob’s natural blue eyes made Steven pull out a smile, but that smile quickly faded away with that ever growing darkness. Bob was the latest to join our group. Professional pianist, pro chess player, S tier table tennis player, Frisbee national team member, rising underdog in tennis, and a very nice guy, as well as a top League of Legends and Rocket League player.
        
        “Are you sure? Eh, doesn’t really matter I supposed,” Steven replied in a shaky voice as he stumbled on the bench. Xander went to the other side and started to stare into his phone, before being joined by Elijah to sweat on a fantastic parkour video game called “Geometry Dash LITE” (They are broke). 
        “Chess?” Bob asked Steven, hoping to cheer him up about his uncertainty.
        “Sure,” Steven replied slowly in uncertainty, before he tilted his head back up to look Bob in the eye.
        “Yeah, sure.” He replied once more in a more assertive tone, putting aside that unpleasant feeling. 
        
        Then, they heard Elijah scream louder than Steven’s neighbour’s snoring at night.
        “I TAPPED YOU MOTHERFU-.”
        
        Right after their chess game, in which Bob clobbered Steven when he “accidentally” blundered his queen, the bell rang, and they hurried to their classes. Steven had maths first with Xander, Bob, and Elijah. It wasn’t long before a reliever came into the classroom. Chatters sparked from around the room, excited that it was a reliever. Xander and Elijah rubbed their hands with excitement, with looks you would find on a cult leader once they found the plans to dominate the world, they knew there would be less work and lots of free time.
        
        “Everyone, quiet down!” Luxury demanded. Luxury was their core class’s class president. She was assertive, loyal, and respectful, just the qualities needed to be class president. She is quite short, with glasses, which makes it unusual for her to be intimidating to the class sometimes, also a major Xander target. Everyone quieted down, leaving a smooth silence to the class as the teacher settled in the teacher's seat, before standing back up and scribbling stuff on the whiteboard.
        “Everyone, there is some work set for you in Google Classroom. Complete the task then do whatever you want.” The reliever spoke as if his dog just died, poor guy, before getting seated back in his seat and opening up Genshin Impact. Small chatters were reborn, as everyone, or at least most people, got their devices out. Tapping and clicking were heard from across the room.
        
        “I wonder where Mr Amad is,” Xander questioned about their math teacher. 
        “Must be sick, I guess,” Jimmy answered naturally. They finished their task sooner than they even expected and started playing “educational” games on their computer. Time passes relatively quickly when you are having fun, which in fact is from playing these games that are not exactly educational. 
        
        As the iconic morning tea bell rang, everyone rushed out of the classroom to meet up with their friends and groups. Steven was the first one there with Jimmy, Xander, and Elijah. They sat down at their usual spot and started eating without the others. The sky got even darker than that morning. It was not raining either; as if it was midnight but during the day. The school had the lights open for students and staff to navigate easily. Now, it was not just Steven, but everyone seemed to be staring and questioning the dark, black, sky. 
        
        “Hey! You are right Steven, something has gone wrong, like what you said in the conversation that I happened to overhear this morning!” Liam said in his usual Indian accent while settling down beside Steven.
        “Yeah, it is not fine,” Bob followed on, grabbing his apple. They stared at the sunless sky, the atmosphere around the school felt dark and moody. The awkward silence slept beside them, as they munched on their food and drinks. Oliver and Charlotte joined them soon after, but the conversation did not go on for long.
        
        BAM! BAM! Loud explosive and intimidating sounds scrambled all over the place. They were scared out of their pants, as everyone heard a loud “ding” from their phones. A notification blossomed on the screen; “Warning, apocalypse in progress. Get to safety immediately!” Oliver dropped his muffin on the ground. They stared at each other, with shocked and intimidated looks, although it was unsure if it was about the warning or the loss of the muffin.
        
        Bush! Pieces of brick and wood flew toward them. What once was a clean white wall was now scattered pieces of materials covered by a cloud of deep, heavy dust. They turned around, still in shock, but are now getting a grasp of the situation. The zombie-like creatures that first appeared in the Middle East, had swum into the world of Andle and broken the defence of Andle's supposedly indestructible military. Through the large unsmooth hole in the wall appeared a mysterious figure's shadow. The creature's eye was empty; with pure greyness and signs of evilness. The creature’s head twisted slowly, like it was teasing its meal, acid-like drool falling down and splashed on the ground. He could see his own reflection; a group of scared and helpless teenagers, as the monster slowly approached their frail souls, step by step.
        
        Chapter 2- Hide From You
        
        Hold up, readers! Before we go into the action stuff, just in case you didn't read the first book of the series "Under the water",you can read it, but if you just refuse to read it, here is a brief understanding of the setting of this series. We are currently in the world of Andle, a country that was located in the middle of the Indian ocean. This country used to be locked away from the rest of the world by an unpleasant dictatorship, like North Korea. But after last year’s agreements, contracts, and protests, the dictatorship had been brought down and a beautiful and fresh new era had begun. Now, this country was in contact with the rest of the world, allowing migrations and other intercountry stuff with its closest alliance being India, as expected being the closest country to Andle. Anyways, let's carry on with the story.
        
        The flood of zombies was growing fast. Their blank eyes wanted them. Jimmy felt like his legs were cinder blocks. Shaking while backing away, Steven looked around his surroundings. “Where can we run, where can we hide?” Steven panicked. His friends were nearly frozen still, slowly backing up from the creatures. Thud! Oliver’s back hit the English block wall behind their back. Everyone could feel their own hearts drop. They reached the end, they have nowhere else to back up.
        
        "Guys, look!" Shouts Liam, pointing towards the door of the science block which was fortunately a few metres away from them. Charlotte and Liam started sprinting towards the door. Following him were Oliver and Charlotte. Jimmy was frozen still though, eyes wide open at the ever closing zombies. 
        
        “Take the flabba jabba and run!” Elijah shouted to Steven while kicking to push back the creatures but then tripped after losing balance on kicking the enemy. God damn they’re light, Elijah thought. Noah slowly backed off towards the door with Xander by slowly slicing away the creatures. But to his amazement, the creatures placed their heads back onto them just soon after they were sliced in half. Without hesitation, Steven grabbed Jimmy and ran towards the door as per commanded by Elijah. 
        
        “Hurry!” Liam shouted, before shutting the door tight. Elijah sighed in relief. Jimmy looked scared and unsure, as he slowly sat on the floor and touched the ground. Steven peeked out the window; tens of creatures were hitting and banging the door that they came through.
        
        “Move away,” Charlotte spoke in a quiet manner before she pulled down the blind. Oliver assisted Charlotte by closing down the rest of the blinds, just to stay hidden from the creatures temporarily.
        
        Suddenly, they heard footsteps approaching from upstairs. The building shook a little, and the lights were turned on. Liam grabbed a bucket beside him and the metallic ruler while Elijah flung off one of his broken sandals and grabbed it tightly like a gun in front of him. The footsteps got louder and louder. They first thought that there was only one, but as the steps got directly above them, they realised that there were two. Steven fiddled his fingers around a box and managed to grab a craft knife. 
        
        A shadow appeared on the wall by the stairs. They backed off to the back door that leads to a courtyard, just in case it is one of those creatures. Jimmy was still sitting on the floor, mentally dead, but Noah pulled him aside by the backdoor with the rest of them. Thud. Thud. Thud.
        
        "AhHhHhHHhHhhH" Jimmy screamed.
        “Back away! I can commit despicable war crimes with my sandals!” Elijah warns the creature as he blindly whips his sandals at the creature.
        "Ah, Ouch Ah! STOP STOP, It’s just me" Shouted Luxury in panic. Grhh. The creature's sound got louder outside. They seemed to be attracted to noises.
        "Shhh!" Ethan whispered. Ethan, also known as E-man by his friends, had ginger-like hair that was quite long for a boy. He was standing next to Luxury, each holding a pair of craft knives and some instant food.
        “I thought you were sick?” Bob asked Ethan, who was supposed to be at home today.
        “Well, I was, but the zombies wrecked my home first so I fled to find you guys possibly. Thank god you guys are alive. By the way, here.” Ethan tossed a “Nerf” single-round pistol along with five bullets to Steven. Steven gave the craft knife to Bob while being relatively confused.
        
        "From what we just saw, these creatures of unknown origin are “zombies”, which are surprisingly light and unkillable.." Luxury analysed.
        "That explains why I fell on top of them when I kicked them just now." Elijah agreed. Luxury continued after a short pause.
        "So we need weapons that deal no damage but are strong enough to push them back, just like E-Man's Nerf gun." As Luxury finished her explanation, Steven no longer looked confused. They drafted out a plan with Xander and Luxury's help in accordance with the help and safety guide; in a matter of an apocalypse, food, and other important needs should first be secured, and the best place to set up a defence location was a supermarket/store. However, who else would be hogging those places other than those grubby green creatures.
        "What about the Warehouse? It has both food and defence supplies." Xander suggested.
        
        They spread out across the science block in the hope of finding useful items, like food and weapons. Steven walked across to the room labelled “JS3L” and kicked open the locked door. Inside was filled with plants and posters that featured “photosynthesis” and other biological stuff. There should be nothing useful here. Steven thought before he noticed a couple of “Pea” plants in small coloured pots by the window. These might be useful for food later on. He grabbed the three with the most pods hanging out and returned to the meeting spot after getting one more orange-covered craft knife.
        
        “That's all you got? I got these metallic rulers.” Xander exclaimed as he saw Steven holding the three small pots and he started to roast the poor Steven.
        “I can’t find anything else good, these might be useful long-term for food, you never know,” Steven answered. One by one, everyone arrived at the meeting point by the stairs. Bob found some duct tape and we wrapped it around our arms to not get bitten, just like in zombie films.
        “Tape fixes everything,” Bob commented, and pretends to wink at the camera, while handing out the tape to everyone. They armed themselves with rulers and crafted knives as weapons and duct tape with cardboard for armour. Somehow Elijah managed to find a "shopping cart" in a class; must be for some science experiment. He also found an extremely powerful weapon. “GUYS GUY, I FOUND METAL SLIPPERS '' he screamed excitedly. Everyone took a cautious step back. They knew what Elijah was truly capable of with a slipper, imagine what he would unleash if he had a metal one. Although it is weird how he can do that… 
        
        “Yeah boi” as Elijah smirked. They placed valuables in the back of the cart and Ethan jumped to the front with his Nerf pistol. Jimmy looked sad and unconfident at the corner, he fiddled and flicked a blade around before sliding it back into his pocket. Steven approached him in a careful way, he tried to open his mouth to speak, but nothing came out; the expression on Jimmy's was too dense and unpleasant, it was worse when he was rick rolled by Steven and Steven thought that was a hellish expression. He patted him on the shoulder and looked at him in a careful, cheerful, and pleasing look. Jimmy tilted his head up and their eyes met. Jimmy nodded and forced a smile. Seeing that the zombies are close to bringing the door down, Jimmy knew it was now or, well…
        
        "Let's get out of here," Jimmy said. They all took one last breath before they got into an escape position.
        
        They blasted off through the back door. Liam and Oliver started slicing the zombies in the way with the metal rulers, followed by Noah, with his lightsaber which seemed to be surprisingly effective against these zombies. They kept coming despite getting pushed back. Not only that, more and more are arriving from corners to disrupt the peace. It would be moments before their resources would be surrounded with those wrinkly green hands if they don’t do something soon.
        
        Elijah scribbled across the cart and found his mighty slipper. With a hand pushing the cart through the horde, the other grabbing at the metal slipper. He looked at the bright shining slipper and cracked a smile. He flinged the slipper at the horde, dealing a hellish amount of damage. However, if you apply the fourth law of the now dead Newton with the air flow and the structure of the slipper followed by how many subs they have on Elijah’s channel, which is by far -1, the slipper flew back like a boomerang. Elijah’s jaws smashed onto the ground as he caught the legendary weapon. “Yes!” as Elijah smirked. They are running now instead of just slowly pushing through. Jimmy was now slightly more confident, using the craft knife, he was slicing zombies at the back who were trying to catch up to them. Oliver was going to the front now to let the front rest a bit. He was slicing zombies without even thinking, he was slicing zombies like there was no tomorrow. He even turned like a bade-blade and slaughtered those zombies. As he stopped turning and caught his breath, he was wide-eyed. “Oh … wow … I never knew killing was this fun, maybe I could try hunting”, but the rest of the group responded with a “NOOOOOOO.” 
        
        In spite of their futile efforts, things are not going well for them, unfortunately. The further they got, the bigger the horde. They were at the school gate now, and the horde was more than 5 times bigger than it was in the beginning. Steven and Ethan, both using Nerf pistols, are about to run out of bullets. Charlotte, Luxury, Oliver, Noah, Bob, and Xander had gotten quite tired from all the swing, swashing and bad-blading to keep those creatures away. They carried on for another metre until they were completely surrounded. Elijah tried ramping over them with the cart but it was no use; the crowd was more dense than Steven’s great great great great grandma. 
        
        "Look!" Bob spoke as he pointed to a relatively huge green leaf on the ground. There were absolutely no trees or plants around, let alone one that produces such a large-sized leaf. With Noah's help pushing the zombies slightly back, he managed to grab the leaf. After taking a few looks at it and thinking that the leaf was nothing but a piece of hot garbage, Bob passed the leaf over to Steven.
        
        It glowed and glowed abnormally. He turned it around and around but other than the glowing nothing seemed special, so he just fling it into the cart. The leaf floated left and right cheerfully, before landing smoothly on the 3 pea plants that Steven placed in the cart. Mysterious and fantasy sounds filled around the plant. Small cyan and green particles danced around. 
        
        "What is going on?" Luxury commented. Noah and Jimmy were trying to push back the horde, so they had no idea what they were talking about, as they continued to fight. But the others had stopped fighting. Instead, they were staring blindly at the glow that seemed to glow larger and brighter every second.
        
        In a blink of an eye, the pea plants had grown huge eyes. They are confused now, very confused. “Oi Lads, a little help here please?!?!?” Noah got annoyed at them for not helping, but as he turned to see them, he was shocked himself too. What in the world? Plants don’t have eyes! Steven stared at the plants in disbelief, as more features such as a large round mouth started appearing. The plants wiggled side to side, before starting to attack the horde by shooting out peas from their mouth. Surprisingly, every single shot of the pea seemed to be very effective against them. In just a single minute, the zombies were pushed back as far as the length of an old tree.
        
        "What did I just witness?" Noah asked rhetorically in shock.
        "Yeah, is this all a dream, is my father finally back?" Elijah further questioned as he pinched his cheeks, before letting out the most terrifying scream. But Xander said no to cool them down. 
        “What if we don’t even exist?” Bob commented with his double thumbs up.
        “My lunch just turned into a living?!?!” Xander exclaimed horrified. 
        "Isn't this just like that game, plants versus zombies 69?" E-man jokes. The boys looked at each other, before letting out a huge laugh.
        "It is what's going on!" Liam confirms as he joined them. Charlotte and Luxury seemed confused, before rejustifying the situation.
        "Come on, this is no time to laugh and joke around, we will figure this out later. Let's first get out of here." Luxury sighed assertively. Steven patted the plant and it smiled brightly, as they got to position. The plants helped a whole lot. They would have probably been turned into one of them without them. After an hour of constant combat, they reached their destination; the Warehouse, where everyone gets a bargain.
        
        Noah placed his lightsaber on the ground and tried to open the door, but it was locked. Xander didn’t think that it was actually locked, just that he was weak, hence he tried himself. He later took a step back and nodded in confirmation that the door was locked. Now Noah is bullying the poor Xander. Luckily the area was zombieless, as if someone had been there. Noah picked up his lightsaber, which was amazingly not broken yet from attacking that amount of predators, and took a swing at the front door. But to their expectations, it didn’t even shake; it was sealed tightly. They took a look around the red and greyly designed building and managed to find a back door.
        
        “Why is there an unlocked back door in most of these buildings, it is just so dumb,” Bob complained in enjoyment. Steven clicked opened the door, and to his surprise, the inside seemed fortified and looted. They got closer together and held their weapons high. Slow, careful human footsteps started to be heard from the three corners. It got louder and louder, as the mood of the group shifted from success and unpleasantness. They might kill us for our resources. Steven felt the goofiness of the dark and mysterious energy, it seemed familiar. The plants had looked exhausted along with them. An hour of combat was just way too much. Steven looked and predicted the situation, there was only one good move here.
        
        “We come in peace! Please show yourselves,” Steven placed his weapon back in the cart. He stepped forward slowly and carefully with his hands up.
        “What are you doing!” Jimmy whispered in fear. But Steven didn’t care, this was the only good move with the highest probability of success. The quiet footsteps stopped. Everything went absolutely silent, along with the plants who hurdled themselves in fear. Wait, do plants even know fear? Over the defence borders made entirely of appliances, shelves, and sandbags, three shadows appeared. Their fear slowly disappeared, as they saw their kind faces.
        
                                                                                …
        They are ready to get to safety and advance. With their new help, they had everything they need; food, water, weapons, and other important needs. Steven looked at the slowly brightening sky with Jimmy, who was more confident and received the survival drive that he needed. The now brave and confident Elijah lifted his right hand, like the great Napoleon and commanded his friends in pleasure: “Fellas, prepare the Pea shooters!”
        
        Chapter 3- Breach 
        The morning before the collapse of Andle
        
        The dark blue sky roamed around all of Andle. Norman sat up in preparation for the day to come. 4:30, reads the digital clock beside his bed. He turned around to face his girlfriend Chloe, who was resting and was not yet awake. He got dressed in his sharp suit. before waking her up.
        
        "Hey, time to wake up, you gotta get ready for your press conference in regard to the apocalypse outside of Andle." He said while shaking her side to side.
        
        Hold up, hey, over here! Sorry to interrupt again but it's me Mr Narrator. 
        If you have not seen the story of the series "Under the water", then here's a brief. In the last story, they met in high school where she saved Norman from the school bully, Jeff. By the way, he died from Failure Syndrome, L bozos slash ratios for being a bully. Anyways, due to a series of events, they faced the sea monster while under the water in an attempt to save agent Edward with the help of Chloe's mom, General Taylor who had already retired. Also, here's an interesting fact, both their fathers died so unlucky and since that they died, they took after the mother's surname. To continue, they got closer after that adventure, both having been promoted and officially added to be part of Andle's national high-ranking officials. They decided to start dating and were going to get married in a week. Not to spoil it, but we know that an apocalypse is going to happen so tough luck with that. If you want to know more, do read Under the Water. Anyways, have fun continuing with the story and I shall disappear into thin air to continue with my work at Failure Management.
        
        "Yeah, I'm awake." She said before she got off the bed and put on her gown. She took her general outfit and asked Norman to get out of the room and get ready in the car while she got dressed, to which Norman replied.
        "Why? Fine I will go wait in the car if you insist." He took his briefcase and walked off to the car. She chuckled before shutting the door after Norman got out and got dressed in that impressive general outfit that looked futuristic and intimidating. The mirror slides open with her command. She looked at herself with confidence, being the youngest female commander, as she adjusted her name tag badge; Commander Taylor. 
        
        Norman was playing Trap Adventure 2 on his phone when Chloe opened the car door. Their work location was just minutes away, so they could actually just walk or bike there, but honestly, for those lads who had only 5 hours of sleep a day from all that work, let them have a break for once in their life. The sky was unseemingly bright for 5 am. There were dark, weird clouds forming from a distance. Norman realised the special that was going on that great distance but didn't bother telling her, as she was focusing on practising her speech. Also, it might be nothing.
        
        They arrived at their office building in a flash. Just as expected, the office was nearly empty since it was this early in the morning. They head to the public conference room where, unlike the rest of the building, several staff and reporters were already at the scene in preparation for the press conference that will commence in about an hour. Corporal Norman, grabbed a drink from the vending machine located in front of the conference room, before grabbing a seat in the front row, chilling, and texting on his phone. While in complete opposition, General Taylor scurried to the backroom, where dozens of materials and files were placed on the table.
        
        "Is this all?" She asked her secretary.
        "Yes, Commander." The male tough-looking secretary replied, before getting out of the room. Commander Taylor scrambled and flicked through the documents and files as fast as a cheetah, before picking out and re-organizing them. She typed in the new information she organised and printed out the final version of the speech. Time passed relatively fast for her. She didn't get to practise much before it was time for the press conference. The secretary re-entered the room and called her out. Before she knew it, she was standing in front of a massive crowd of reporters, giving her speech about the current situation.
        
        "You done? I was wondering if you want to have breakfast together, Jules said that she had something important to tell us." Norman questioned Chloe, who was packing up the messy speech papers and documents that were lying on the podium.
        "Hmm, don’t you have some explaining to do, Norman, barging into the frame like that?”
        “Hehe,” Norman giggled.
        “Well, you go ahead first, I have to return some documents back to my office," Chloe replied, before entering the backroom to get her stuff.
        "Okay as you say, Madam." He mocks, before chuckling and walking out of the conference room. The press conference room, which was filled with reporters a minute ago, was now left completely empty once Chloe walked out of the room. She got to the 'Women's room' and changed back into her casual working outfit. She checked her watch, 8:15 am, just to realise that she was late for her organised breakfast with Jules and Norman. I wonder what important information she had to share. She took the lift and arrived at her floor. To her surprise, it was completely empty, as if it was deserted.
        
        "Hello?" She asked the thin, isolated, clear air circulating around the room. They must've all gone to have a team breakfast or something without me. Sad. She walked to the bare outside of her room and noticed her secretary's wallet on the table and his cracked phone on the ground. It was at this moment, she knew that something was wrong. She hovered around where his secretary was supposed to sit, just to find his fresh dead body that red, unpolluted blood was still leaking out of. She took a step back and quickly tried to ring headquarters with her walkie-talkie multiple times, before realising that trying to get the corp’s help was as easy as beating Trap Adventure 2 in last chance mode and initially giving up. She tried her phone too later on, but not a single soul responded. I can't be scared, I am a commander.  She decided to examine the dead body. It had a few broken ribs and a bite mark on his hand. Suddenly, she heard a banging inside her office. It was smashing through the door and the walls simultaneously. Weird. She took her pistol out and held it tightly in front of her, as she took small silent steps towards her office door, which is currently where the noise is coming from.
        
        She kicked the door open to review a zombie-like creature. The ugly male zombie started dashing toward Chloe. Bang! Bang! Shoot. The zombie didn't even get affected; the bullet just went right through it. She acted fast and quickly changed her plan to attend the zombie melee by kicking it. To her surprise, it was very light. She flung the zombie off the window, before taking a step back and closing the window. What the heck? She placed her pistol which seemed useless back in her pocket. Creak. She unsuspectedly lost her balance; it's like something pushed her out the window. As she fell, she turned her back towards the ground and looked up. Shatters of glasses rained down on her, along with her secretary, who seemed undead. I should have known that the apocalypse outside has been spread through to Andle at this moment. We acted too slowly and recklessly. I should have known that they infect others with a bite. I should have known that they can't be killed. She injected countless thoughts into her mind, before turning back to face the ground. Goodbye world.
        
        "Got you." A woman shouted. The car drifted past and was now speeding along the deserted road. Beside the woman was Norman, who was the one drifting and speeding the car around. She quickly realised that the woman was Jules.
        "Jules! I thought I was a goner!" Chloe exclaimed as she saw that familiar face from years ago.
        "It was thanks to my latest invention." Jules showed off a high-tech-looking grapple gun.
        "What in the world happened?" She asked the two.
        "Breach, the mighty world or now country of Andle had been breached! I was gonna tell you guys to inform the press but I guess it's too late. I should have placed my device further away so there would be more time." Jules explained. 
        "Let's find some survivors," Norman suggested. They continued to speed along the deserted road. Unfortunately, they can't find any 'humans'; the walkways beside the road were covered in these zombie creatures. They decided that they should send out a 'government warning' so people unaffected so far can prepare and evacuate. The road got calmer and calmer the further they got away from the central city. Half-broken light bulbs from street lamps blinked and cracked. The sky, which was supposed to be bright and sunny, was dark and grim. Eventually, they ran out of fuel at "the Warehouse".
        
        "Let's base here for now and get resources. The commander stated. They slowly hopped off the vehicle and grabbed a few sticks instead of guns, since she had explained to the two others that guns just pierce through the zombies due to the sharpness of the bullets. They peered around the corner towards the main door and found several zombies chilling around the front automatic door. They stared for a few more seconds before the zombies turned towards them. Too late. They dashed towards the door with Norman at the front. Kicking and smashing the zombies away from them. Unfortunately, the front sliding door did not slide open for them; they forgot that the electricity must have been cut out. 
        
        They put their backs to one another and switched to the defensive. Chloe turned to look around the building while still banging the zombies backward. Searching for entrances and possible basing locations. It was quite a while before she noticed a paper that was pinned to the wall inside that consisted of the diagram of the building's floor plan. There was a backdoor. She signaled the two to follow her with hand signals. They advanced towards the car until they made a turn towards the other side of the building. It was at this point, Norman was struck by confusion.
        
        "Aren't we heading back in the car?" He asked, before throwing his weapons towards a zombie that was dashing towards them.
        "That car was out of fuel, so we wouldn't last in there, just trust me, I am a commander after all," Chloe commanded, before starting to speed through a gap between the zombies. 
        
        Jules and Norman followed her, with Jules barely catching up. Norman noticed the door in front of them and understood what she meant about knowing what she was doing. He got there first and opened the luckily unlocked door. He held it tightly while waving at the others to hurry up. Once they were all in, he shut the door right before locking it and placing a nearby broomstick between the handles of the door. Together, they placed their backs against the door until finally, the unending banging stopped.
        
        "Phew, that was close." Jules sighed breathlessly. The sharp nice-looking suit that Norman was wearing this morning now had torn sleeves and is covered in sweat and blood stains. They stayed there for another minute, before separating to get supplies. Chloe was in charge of weaponry, so she headed to the back area, where the dangerous things are. She pulled her pistol out and held it in front of her tightly out of instinct, before remembering that it wasn't effective and grabbed her knife instead. She turned to the left in the hope to find a bag to carry the equipment around but unsuspectedly a zombie hopped out and started drooling over her. Eww. 
        
        She stayed it hard before using her already exhausted leg to kick it. It was as tiring as doing the Russian kick dance for an entire hour straight. The zombie that was as light as a feather flew speedily before hitting the shelf. Just like she expected, the now crazily shaped zombie stood back up and started to walk towards its prey slower than before. She kicked it one more time and another. Each time, the zombie did get slower, but it seemed never ending; like an immortal shark trying to get to its prey no matter what. Rope. She dashed towards it with all her might and punched it hard. The zombie that was leaking out flesh and blood fell back to his doom. Cracking and twisting sounds emerged again from it. But before it can fully piece itself back to its original state, Chloe tied it to a shelf's leg. The zombie hovered and jibbered, but it was the end of it. Since it was too light to break free with its weak features and its bite doesn't affect unalive matter. She managed to find a bag and got the stuff.
        
        She was reunited with the others and started to build and fortify themselves inside, since most of the exterior was made of glass instead of hard, solid walls. Norman got as many as seventy-seven small slight scorpion-sized scented soft sabbatical safety survival sandbag struggle sacks surrounding the base, while Jules set up a sleeping area and installed a power plant to store power using batteries that she found. Chloe stared out of the window. The zombies that were crowding around the store just minutes ago had now all disappeared, as if it was distracted by something. She placed the sticks and other weapons hanging beside the sandbags and gave one to everyone, before releasing the locked door to escape in an emergency. She hovered over to the clothing section and grabbed some nice military-style clothing to change into after all that yucky substance from the zombies got on to her. After quickly getting changed, the sounds of typing by Jules had begun. Chloe slowly hovered around to have a peek at what she was typing.
        
        "What are you typing Jules?" She asked Jules, curiously.
        "I am trying to connect to the international space station to see if anyone is still using and connecting the signal, and it seems that the Americans are still good." She said before a radio seemed to connect to the laptop's speaker.
        "Don't worry my fellow Americans. This is all a host, it's a host made by the Chinese just like how climate change is also a host. And what in the world is the length of the zombie if they're 170 centimetres?  Cause what is a centimeter!!" A white Trump-like noise echoed through the speaker, before a repeating static noise emerged and quieted down. 
        
        
        "Where's Justin by the way?" Chloe asked carefully.
        "Well, he was sick. But I hope that he is okay in this situation, before sniffing and feeling down.
        "He will be fine, he is quite strong. Don't you trust him?" Chloe encouraged her.
        "Yes." She replied and slowly regained confidence. Justin was their friend and Jules's Husband, they have just gotten married 6 months ago. He was with them for operation 'Under The Water' and got close to Norman and Chloe through this. He was now working as a fitness tracker and manager.
        
        Footsteps started approaching from around the building. Silently, they grabbed their weapons and held them tight inside the fortified base. The footsteps seemed odd for zombies so they slowly approached the footsteps. It got louder and louder every second before it went really silent. It was now as silent as a draught. They faced the front door, where the footsteps were last heard, but nothing was to be seen. Suddenly, they heard a little discussion from the front door. Then a wack. “Oh … so it was locked…”. 
        
        Before another voice replied from beside. 
        “Bruh, are you serious?!?! I don’t know what makes you so stupid but it works!” 
        
        “Damn, what a roast” whispered Chloe. The door behind them was kicked open. They quickly turned around and held their weapons tightly. Soon, a few figures appeared.
        
        "We come in peace! Please show yourselves,” a teenager's voice appeared. It's just a few kids. They loosened their weapons and walked towards the backdoor. The teenagers watched them walk until they got to a rendering distance. They all smiled in happiness, someone else other than them is alive. They might be able to survive this.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Chapter 4- Knock on your doorOut the gate
        
        “No way! Aren’t you guys from TV!” Ethan shouted like he just met The Rock Johnson. Distant rumbling had been reborn with disgusting noises. Ethan was quickly shut up by Norman, and they were let into the ‘safe zone” that the three had set up. This time, Chloe remembers and sealed the door tight with that plank. They shared their information about these zombie-like creatures. Little or large, every relevant information was shared between them.
        “So you are saying that these toy gun blasters were effective against them?” Jules confirmed with them as Ethan showed them off.
        “And a lightsaber?” Norman confusedly stated. The red lightsaber was now half broken with scratches all over it and the light zapping on and off simultaneously. 
        “What about the slipper?” Chloe continues the mass confusion. The three stared at the teenagers in disbelief, before a zombie revealed itself from the ‘toy’ section of the store. In an instant, Noah pulled out his lightsaber and sliced the zombie in two. While it was putting itself back together, a newly designed unworn slipper thrown by Elijah further damaged it. Norman looked at the kids in confusion, while Chloe quickly grabbed some rope she scavenged and tied the zombie to the leg of a couch that was on display. And just for fun, Ethan just adds a 99% off discount sign for fun.
        
        “Wow!” Ethan exclaimed shockingly. Rows and rows of new cool-looking nerf blasters were displayed on the shelf. From fast-firing automatic rifles to scoped, ranged snipers. He scanned the products quickly before grabbing a few semi-automatic battery magazine-powered rifles and attachments such as scopes, bullets, and extra mags before placing them into a shopping cart nearby. Steven was with him. As Ethan waved him to follow back to the main circle, Steven hesitated and turned back to look at the items. Colourful and large quantities of blasters were now spread across disorganised unlike before. He can’t get his eyes off a cool-looking shotgun, he had seen this gun before. He snatched it along with a few extra shotgun shells and ran back towards Ethan, who was opening the boxes and handing out the weapons.
        
        “I had no idea which weapons you guys prefer, so here I got similar weapons for all.” Ethan stood proudly while giving out bullets.
        
        “Thanks.” Liam thanked.
        “You should have gotten a sniper for us. It is better in terms of range.” Xander complained.
        “Plus we can learn how to quickscope!” Ejilah adds on.
        “We need speed, not just range.” Ethan clarified as Elijah and Noah returned with new weapons.
        “This looks like the M16, I like it!” Norman exclaimed while reloading the toy rifle. 
        “Yeah. But it was slightly different from the actual one. Semi-automatic, 20 rounds extended magazine, scoped, elite 2.0 darts,  and is AA battery powered. It is very good in terms of DPS for a toy gun.” Ethan continued proudly, before getting interrupted by Xander.
        “We don’t care, okay! Anyways, I think we need to quickly load up to get to the location the commander told us about.” Xander complained while looking in the direction of where Chloe is.
        “I don’t need a gun, I have my slippers!” Elijah showed off the new slippers that he got from the clothing section. “Also you all sound like a bunch of nerf nerds here”. He chucked one to the ground in front. To everyone's surprise, it bounced back up with its rubber design and boomeranged it back toward him. Like Thor in the Marvel movies, he catches it single-handedly and placed it on his new survival backpack. “Damn, those 2 years of training really paid off”. Noah swang his lightsaber around, admiring the new cyan look from the old red one. After handing out the guns, Steven decided to head towards the electrical power station that was set up by Jules to hopefully get some batteries from the weapons. He hovered around and asked Jules, to which she replied with a yes without hesitation and pointed towards the small box beside the power station. Before getting the batteries, he plugged his phone which now contains a small crack to the side from the crashing and the dashing in the escape to a nearby charging line. Click. He got up and turned towards the batteries. After just a single step, he stopped still and stared at Jules’s computer screen in observation. There, an image of a map with points headed from the middle east toward the rest of the world was displayed along with images of a large hole in the ground and a zombie image. Surprisingly, the arrows that stretched from the middle-east to the rest of the world were reflected off the North-American continent. 
        
        “Are we going to that hole where all the zombies are coming from?” Steven asked, and Jules instantly slammed her laptop screen shut.
        “No, we will be sending you kids to America if they let us in, it’s safe there.” She replied, after scooching him off to grab the batteries. He returned to the main spot, which they complained to him for being slow.
        “What took you so long?” Ethan asked as he attached the batteries to the guns.
        “Nothing,” he said, before taking a seat on a folding chair and grabbing a can of coke. Steven turned around to take a look at the plants. Unexpectedly, they were not recovering; they look more tired, exhausted, and somehow smaller as every second passed. He quickly suggested the situation to the group in regard to the pea shooters. They went deep into thought for a second before the teenagers said the exact same word at the exact same time.
        “Water!” They looked at each other in shock. What in the world. They went to get water as Norman struggled to understand their timing. Steven looks behind and finally realizes the isolated pressenceless Jimmy. He had been sitting there the whole time and yet not a single one of them realized his existence; almost as if he didn't even exist. Jimmy looked at Norman with anger in his eyes; as if he had killed his mother. Elijah realizes and reassures Steven.
        “He should be fine. Let’s confront him after we get the water.” Elijah assured before heading back to catch up with the six friends; Oliver, Noah, Xander, Charlotte, Luxury, and Ethan. Steven headed towards Jimmy before Norman stood up and stopped him mid-way.
        “Leave him to me, I am the one that he needs to talk to,” Norman said in a serious matter. Steven quickly got the hint, turned back, and jogged to the water. After filling a large 2-liter bottle to the max, they headed back toward the centre, where Chloe was waiting for them cautiously. 
        
        “What is going on with these plants?” She asked the group, before realising the large amount of water that they brought with them. 
        “Oh.” she continued, as she turned back to have a seat. Charlotte poured some water on the plant’s soil. Just as expected, the plants danced happily as they were showered by their cure.. Xander took a seat beside Elijah, before looking around them to find Jimmy. Jimmy was nowhere to be seen, so he questioned.
        “By the way, where is Jimmy?” 
        “I saw him and Norman head toward the back there,” Chloe pointed to the shelf to the right. With the semi-transparent shelf wall, they could see the two feet. They looked at the barely visible figure for a second, before turning back to sort out the items. I hope that everything is okay. 
        “Kitkat?” Elijah offers.
        
        Jimmy was now facing Norman, who was about half a head taller than him. Norman knows what’s going on, and starts with a calm greeting.
        “How are you going?”
        “What do you think, tennis head?” Jimmy replied angrily.
        “Look kid, I am terribly sorry about your parents.” He said with both of his hands out apologetically.
        "Don't you think that money can ever make me accept your apology, dumbass!"
        "I am terribly sorry, but I am sure that I have done everything I could." 
        "What do you mean you had done everything you could? Giving me money every single month? You can give me a mansion, a Tesla, NordVPN, North Korea, America, Earth, the Milky Way and I would still be pissed as a bull looking at a red carpet. Not even giving the whole world could fill my endless void of anger, nephew of a Murderer" Jimmy took one final angry sigh, before turning back towards the center. But Norman pulled him back quickly as if he wanted to reveal something.
        "Ok Jimmy, I admit that I have not done enough to repay you for your parent's death, but I am sure there is something you need to know." Norman assertively talked.
        "What do you think I need to know?" He replied sarcastically.
        "Your dad did not get murdered by my uncle, he died from drowning. Your mum did not die by suicide, she died of a particle cannon. The government said that she suicided to cover it up. My Uncle took the blame and was framed as a murderer."
        
        12 years ago…
        
        The sky is calm. The sun is warm. The ocean is blue. The clouds are huge.
        
        It was just another day in Andle, and Jimmy’s dad, Lob, was assigned to a rather dangerous mission. Working with the government’s rescue, Lob has to conduct and operate many rescue missions. This specific mission seemed rather dangerous compared to others, so in the thought of his wife and his 3-year-old boy, he turned it down without hesitation. The government managed to find someone else as a replacement, but he was placed on standby. 
        
        It was soon the day of the operation, 7 am, Caro Robert, the person that replaced Lob for this underwater mission, read on his watch. He hopped into his car and turned the key. In a whoosh, the vehicle came alive, and Rescue Agent Caro sped out of his driveway. As he drove past, the phone in his pocket rang in a special synthesiser played ringtone. 
        
        “Hello, Rescue agent Caro Roberts speaking.”
        “Hey, brother! I heard you have a mission going on this early in the morning. Ooh, you are all dressed smartly in your uniform, nice!” Kann Robert, Norman’s dad, and Caro Roberts's brother spoke. 
        “Yeah, I am going right now, this is quite a dangerous mission.” He said without looking at the phone to concentrate on driving.
        “I wish you luck,” Kann spoke excitedly.
        “Shh, don’t talk too loud, aren’t your 11-year-old kid sleeping?” he questioned.
        “Yeah, wanna see your nephew?”
        “Sure.” The call turned into a video call format, with the camera hovering and turning until eventually settling in the sight of a young boy sleeping. 
        “He had all grown up now since the last time I saw him!” Caro exclaimed. The call returned to normal and Kann placed the phone back on by his ears. 
        “Yeah. Gotta wake him up soon for school.”
        “Gotta go now, thanks for calling bro!” Caro spoke firmly, before placing the phone back in his pocket. He reached a junction, and the light turned red. He was at the very front of the line, making him think that if he was just a bit earlier, he would have been able to get through this 2-minute-long traffic wait. He sat there and chilled.
        
        After a long wait, the traffic light was about to turn green. On the other way, a truck that was supposed to slow down as the light turned yellow, sped faster in an attempt to pass through the light. Caro was awakened by a honk from the back. Oopsies, shouldn’t have fallen asleep. Without looking, he stepped on the pedal and accelerated. Suddenly, he realised the truck that was about to crash into him and attempted to brake, but it was too late. The cars at the back were placed at an emergency stop. Unluckily, Caro along with his car was flung to the moon.
        
        “Agent Lob, something went wrong with agent Caro, we need you to take over.” The phone spoke before getting disconnected. In hesitation, he changed into his rescue outfit and drove to the scene in a flash to catch up for the lost time. The scene was to be underwater, in an attempt to rescue an agent in need. The mission went smoothly to start with. Just as headquarters planned, he managed to get past the guards and arrive in the room next to the location where the agent was supposed to be prisoned. He stealthily walked along the wall, before reaching the door. Twist! Why is this unlocked? He turned and opened the unlocked door in a second. Before he had time to react, alarms blared redly and he was surrounded by sea creatures. He turned again to look at the agent that he was supposed to rescue, but there was no one; he had fallen right into their trap.
        
        After losing communications with Agent Lob, headquarters quickly tried to find out a solution, while Agent Lob’s wife was notified. Being horrified, she drove to the headquarters after leaving the three-year-old at her neighbour’s house. After entering the building, she realised that they were planning another rescue towards the underwater fort. She quickly begged the commander to let her go along with the rescue.
        “If there is anyone that knows where he might be waiting for help, it would be me!”
        After getting persuaded, the base general allowed her to go along with the crew in a submarine. Slowly but surely, they submerged and were on the way to rescue the agents.
        
        After nearly reaching the under-water fort headquarters received an emergency message: ‘Particle cannon hijacked! Particle cannon hijacked!’
        “Sh#t!” The general shockingly spoke firmly, trying not to panic the whole room and warn the savers. But it is again too late, before he got connected to the opposite side's speaker, a blue ray of beam struck through the submarine, leaving nothing but dust and dust alone. The screen on the headquarters flashed blue, before leaving a loud distinctive noise and a black screen.
        
        “Sorry! I am terribly sorry. I shouldn’t have done that. I shouldn't have rushed.” The man in his 50s said. He was the truck driver and was currently being questioned by the police.
        “Mike Lemons, interesting name. And a 3-year-old son.” The detective spoke calmly. 
        “Yes, that's me, I will pay for my crimes. But at least let me raise my son first! He will die without me, he has no money to survive and he’s only three!” He pleaded with the detective, but the detective made a come-back with a disturbing statement.
        “Do you know that the person you killed had an 11-year-old nephew? What about that since the guy you hit died, he had to forfeit from a rescue mission that killed an agent that has a 3-year-old son along with his mother? At least your kid still has a mum and you will be released soon, but what will you do about the small baby, called Jimmy!” He smacked the table hard, before leaving the room. The driver was left speechless and stopped pleading.
        
        No one ever tried to interfere with the sea creatures since then, until operation “Under the Water.”
        
        …
        
        “No no no! Your uncle killed my parents! Your uncle murdered my dad, Your uncle made my mum suicide from the stress of my dad dying! Don’t you think that something like this could make me forgive you. You are lying, right? You are lying!” Jimmy said, before tearing up and running out the gate to The Warehouse’s outdoor plant section. Norman let out a sigh and tried to approach and chase after Jimmy again, but he was stopped by Charlotte, who looked a bit irritated. 
        
        “What have you said to him that made him like that!” She spoke while trying not to sound too angry, before walking out towards the outdoor section. The rest of the group stared at them before slowly getting up. Jules, who was typing maniacally the last second ago stopped and looked over expressionless. Steven looked at the verbal fight in disbelief and blamed himself hard. If  only I was as courageous and kind as Charlotte. I could not even talk to a friend in need of support, let alone stand up for him. 
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Chapter 5- To America!
        
        “Hey, you good?” Charlotte asked, before taking a seat next to Jimmy. She brushed her hair backward as she slowly settled. Jimmy was not crying, at least that is what he wanted others to think. Charlotte could underlyingly see drips of tears dripping down his hands.
        “I don’t know what he said but.” She spoke, before taking one more breath and swallowing.
        “We will get past this. We will survive this apocalypse.” She said assertively. Jimmy wasn’t convinced at all; What's the point of surviving when there’s no one to go to? She walked away in disappointment that her words of encouragement didn’t encourage him. Jimmy has been left aside, as the rest prepared to flee. Norman invited Steven to come with him outside to possibly find a vehicle.
        
        “Good luck you two.” Commander Taylor stated as they walked outside as silently as an FBI looking for the forbidden files. The once very dark sky was now grayish. Norman was holding his Nerf rifle that Ethan had selected and Steven got his Nerf shotgun out and Elijah got his less impressive slipper out.
        
        “You look that side, I look this side,” Norman commanded. Without hesitation, Steven turned and quickly crossed the road. Door to door, Steven was currently checking the vehicles with high expectations. Cross-fingers, hope there’s a tank nearby. One, two, five, ten… After over ten searches, his hopes were not crushed but significantly lowered. 
        
        “Anything?” Norman shouted across the road. Steven looked up and shook his head in disappointment, before approaching the final vehicle in sight. The vehicle was a light-brown coloured 4-seater pickup truck. Not a cool-as tank, but it's at least something. The blinds on the side windows are downed, but Steven could see a nice, green glow beneath it. He pulled the handle towards the driver's seat. To his surprise, it was unlocked.
        
        Suddenly a zombie was sitting dead on the driver’s seat. It was wearing a half-torn brown suit. Unlike other zombies, this one had a glow, a green glow. Norman quickly took notice of it and fired a few bullets at it. Despite the special appearance, it got knocked back like other normal zombies. One, two, three, four… On the fifth shot, the zombie took one final swing backward, before slowly kneeling and falling down. The zombie turned into ashes within seconds, and a green, glowing large leaf hovered in the air gently as it navigated downwards. 
        
        Steven picked up the leaf and stared at it. I had seen this before. He quickly recalls the exact same shape and glows from the leaf that they found on the way to the warehouse. It was the magic leaf; the leaf that turned eyeless plants into plants with eyes. The leaf that allowed the plants to act and defend against the undead.
        
        “Hey? Is that vehicle working?” Norman shouted to Steven from across the street. He walked towards the abandoned pickup truck where Steven was staring intensely at the leaf. Steven jumped frightened at the realisationrealization that someone was behind his back. Before his instincts turn into kill mode, he realisedrealized that it was Norman and took a deep breath before explaining the leaf to Norman. Norman was shocked and confused at first but slowly understood as Steven explained. 
        
        “Wow! Let’s take this back to the others; we might be able to use it to get more defencesdefenses. Hop in the pickup truck with me, we will drive it close to the building.” Steven shoved the green growing leaf into his pocket.
        “Yes. Also umm. What did you discuss with Jimmy? I had been his neighbourneighbor and friend for 4 years now, and yet I had never seen him act like this before.” Steven questioned while trying not to ruin the already ruined mood that Norman had with the others.
        “Since you have been with him for 4 years, I think I can tell you, but please don’t tell the others,” Norman spoke assertively and seriously, as he told Steven about the mission and Jimmy’s parents.
        
        The 20-second ride was awfully quiet, ever since Steven heard Norman’s story, he felt sad and pitiful towards them both; they both lost someone close to them, yet they never really got compensation or got comforted. Yet all this time, he complained to Jimmy about his parents and always used them as excuses, when Jimmy suffered it worse and just kept quiet. They parked the car right in front of the back door, and the others loaded up the truck. 
        
        Thoughts floated around his head. After a while, he made a decision. “I have to go talk to him,” Steven said assertively, before going back into the store and heading toward Jimmy. 
        
        “Hey, I heard what happened to your parents, I’m sorry,” Steven spoke while facing Jimmy, who was sitting on the floor with a face like he got just a merit on his science test, and by any asian standards, that’s not good. Jimmy quickly realisedrealized Steven’s existence and looked up at the standing figure. He looked sad and pitiful for a second, before turning back mad.
        “Did that stupid guy tell you, I clearly told him not to share anything,” Jimmy said with a half-mad expression.
        “Yes, but I don’t think that it was his fault. His uncle died too.”
        “Well, I think it's his fault.”
        “No. If you really wanted to blame someone, blame the driver.”
        “I blame them all. And I had blamed his uncle and that uncle’s family all these years and shall continue to blame them. I will get my revenge!”
        “If you want to get revenge, you have to survive first. Get a grip of yourself and let's survive this Apocalypse.”
        “Why would I want to survive? Even after I got my revenge, what’s the point? As there is no one waiting for me at home after all.”
        “Jimmy, I had been with you for years, have you ever considered me as someone who thinks that you are important? Have you ever thought about how your friends would feel if you are gone? Don’t you ever feel us as someone important and worth surviving for!” Steven raised his voice a bit too much, he thinks. Jimmy stopped. He stood up and looked blankly through Steven, as there was no one there. I have my friends. 
        
        The garden door that leads to the outside blew open. They were communicating too loud before realisingrealizing that zombies had been slowly breaking the door. Boom! The zombies ran full maniacally toward them. Steven quickly realisedrealized and pushed Jimmy beside him. The zombie that was about to hit and attack Jimmy knocked himself onto the wall. Steven looked at the zombie for a sec in disbelief. Zombies weren't that fast at all before. Yes. They were way slower before. Steven hovered to the side in an attempt to find his shotgun, but it was too late, the zombies had completely surrounded them. They walked slowly towards them. Oh, shoot. Flum! Steven quickly turned behind where the sounds of flame were heard. Apparently, the fast zombie that he knocked out stood back up again, but it appears that Jimmy had woken up from his depression too.
        
        “You are right, let’s survive this first,” Jimmy said assertively, before turning back to face the rest of the zombies in front of them after making sure that the fast zombie with glasses had been completely burned into ashes. They kicked and punched the zombies while slowly moving backward. Bonk! It was no use, the crowd was too dense, denser than last time. They had their backs against the wall now. In no time, they would become one of them if they didn’t come up with a solution before then. They can’t shout for help, that would only lure more zombies. Steven rumbled and fiddled in his pocket in an attempt to find something useful, and in fact, he did find something useful. It was the green, glowing leaf. He forgot to give it to the others for a look with his dense and many complicated thoughts just now. 
        
        Jimmy took notice of the leaf and found a plant next to them. The other plants were way too far from them, so even though the plant seemed to have just been taken out from an oven, he grabbed the leaf from Steven’s palm and placed it in that half-burnt pea plant pot.
        
        Lights and particles danced around the plant for a second, before the plant was awakened. Eyes and a large round mouth popped out from the pea plant, just like last time. But Steven noticed something unusual about this one; It was red-orangey. 
        “Pea-shooter! Help us out here please!” He asked while kicking the zombies. The plant smiled and wiggled around for a while, before starting to shoot fireballs. 
        
        Bish! Bish! The fireballs directly hit the zombies. The shots seemed useless at first, but after a couple more shots, flames were shot up and surrounded the zombies from head to toe. 
        “Brains!” The zombie in front pleaded in a pitiful and sad manner for one last time, before it turned completely into ashes. Whoa. In less than a minute, the room was completely cleared of zombies.
        
        Jimmy grabbed the half-empty water bottle and spilled some water on the plant. With their new plant friend, they quickly jogged out of the room and closed the door that separates the garden and the rest of the store. 
        
        “Are you okay? Look, I’m sorry for…”Norman tried to apologize and reason with Jimmy, but Jimmy spoke up before he could finish talking.
        “We shall continue this after we survive,” Jimmy spoke as he turned back to grab some leftover small stuff up the pickup.
        
        After a while, the pickup was fully loaded and modified to fit them all in; with an extended backspace and a strong and sharp-looking cow catcher to barge through zombies. Jules re-explained the plan to them all, about getting to the airport to get their private jet To America.
        
        They are ready to get to safety and advance. With their new help, they had everything they need; food, water, weapons, and other important needs. Steven looked at the slowly brightening sky with Jimmy, who was more confident and received the survival drive that he needed. The now brave and confident Elijah commanded his friends in pleasure: “Fellas, prepare the Pea shooters!”
        
        …
        
        The 11 kids sat in the back of the old pickup truck with their Nerf rifles and weapons out as the driver navigated through the deserted streets of the city. The sun was rising, and the sky was pink and orange, a beautiful contrast to the chaos that had ensued just hours prior.
        
        The streets that used to be filled with panicked people were now dead silent. Norman drove the pickup truck at a relatively decent speed since driving too fast would mean too loud, and too loud means zombies. Zombies mean fight, fight means lose bullets, lose bullets means exhausted plants, exhausted plants mean, well you get the point (They’re screwed).
        
        “Turn right.” Jules assisted Norman with the direction and route that is the safest with the thermal sensor that she built from radars and thermal goggles attached to the vehicle. This machine was kinetically connected to her laptop through a small chip with some government tech attached underneath. Norman, looking determined to get to the airport, weaved in and out of abandoned cars and debris. The two were focusing on transportation at the front with Chloe, who managed to squeeze in with them.
        
        In the back, the group is quiet, each lost in their own complicated thoughts while trying to not lure in any threats with their sound. Liam sat nervously at the extended back trunk facing the back. He looked out to the open, isolated streets as they drove past with his hands fidgeting with the straps of his backpack. Bob, on the other hand, sat at the front of the back trunk, looking behind him where the sunrise was exposed. Since it is not a great time to get car sick during a zombie apocalypse. Steven doesn’t feel like chatting too after being told of Norman’s and Jimmy’s horrifying past. He just sat stoically, his eyes scanning the area for any signs of danger. He held the shotgun in his lap, loaded and at the ready. Charlotte patted and chilled with the plants. She invited Luxury, but Luxury insisted on sitting on the opposite side as if she was trying to avoid the plants.
        
        As they neared the airport, the group’s anxiety began to rise. They could see smoke rising from a distance, and the sound of gunfire echoed in the air. Norman took a deep breath, his hands tightening on the steering wheel.
        
        “There might be people in front, should we save them too?” Liam asked with his head turned to be looking inside, directly towards the rest of the group, with his calm demeanourdemeanor belying the fear in his voice.
        
        “We will save them if we can, we will see when we get closer, right Norman?” Luxury responded with an ask for confirmation from the driver.
        
        Norman nodded firmly. “Yes, we will see if that’s everyone’s best option.”
        As they drove closer to the airport, they began to encounter more and more of the undead. Most of them were sluggish and slow, but there wereare some which were fast and hard to get rid of, like the one with glasses and a newspaper. Also, there were so many of them that the group was forced to drive through them, feeling the thump of bodies against the undercarriage of the truck.
        
        With every passing minute, the group grew more tense, their eyes scanning the area for any signs of danger. They were quickly running out of bullets in their rounds and reloading while the air-soft bullets inside a large box in the middle were decreasing speedily. They will run out of bullets sooner or later. Xander quickly realisedrealized this and questioned, but the question was quickly put down with one simple answer from Jules; we just have to quickly get to the airport, we have no choice. They were concentrating hard, as they were all keenly aware of the fact that one wrong move could mean the end of all of them. Throughout the ride, they found no survivors by the time they got past the gunshots and smoke. The places all seem deserted, but it was clear that there had been battles recently. The air was thick with the scent of smoke and gunpowder, and the ground was littered with debris. It seemed that they have lost the battle and possibly had been turned into zombies. Finally, they arrived at the airport, and Norman skidded to a stop in front of the entrance.
        
        “Okay, everyone out,” Norman said, as he climbed out of the pickup truck. Bob, Liam, Oliver, and Charlotte took the supplies out and held it tightly in front of them, while the others got their weapons and slowly scanned the area cautiously. They moved quickly, their eyes peeled for any sign of danger. 
        After a few minutes of walking, they reached a door that leads to the runway. Outside, they could see a small, private jet that seemed to be fueling up halfway before badness happened. With her key, the commander twisted it and the door was flung wide open. Unexpectedly, there were no zombies anywhere to be seen around the aircraft.
        
        The group exchanged a quick glance, and then moved quickly towards the runway. As they ran, they could feel the weight of the situation pressing down on them. They were so close to escaping this nightmare, but they knew that danger was far from over. Elijah got to the plane first and hovered the rest on. On the plane, Norman quickly got behind the controls, his hands moving rapidly across the switches and dials before getting joined by Chloe, who sat in the co-pilot’s seat. The rest piled in behind him, their hearts racing with anticipation. “Umm, did I tell anyone that I have air sickness?” Elijah whispered.
        
        “Come on, come on! Yes!” Norman proudly spoke while trying to keep his noise down in excitement. To their luck, the jet had plenty of fuel left.
        With a roar, the engines came to life, and the plane began to move. The group held on tight, their eyes fixed on the runway ahead. They could see that the undead had begun to gather at the edge of the runway, their eyes fixed on the plane as it slowly began to taxi to the main runway. At first, only slow zombies manoeuvremaneuver toward the aircraft. But after just a few quick seconds, faster and faster zombies dashed towards the jet. They thought that they could make it, but the zombies started to knock against the window, hard. 
        
        “They will break the window at this rate!” Xander screamed.
        “Yeah, this is not good, how long are we gonna be on the ground taxiing before we reach the takeoff runway?” Steven questioned the pilot. But his response is not good.
        “We need half more minutes, we won’t make it in time!” Norman spoke in panic. They looked out at the gathering zombies. Anyone can tell with their common sense that they won’t make it in time. They won’t have time to take off and won’t be able to make it To America consequently.
        
        “Open the plane door!” Oliver shouted. 
        “What! Why!” Steven shouted back in panic.
        “Just do it gosh,” Oliver shoutedly replied. The sound of the engines of the plane is now very loud, as it makes one final turn to the runway. Jules looked at the zombies outside of the window, to the long runway, and back to Oliver. She looked him in the eye; she could feel his strong unyielding determination. She pulled open the door and zombies started crawling in the plane. With his new lightsaber, Noah went to the front and started to push and block zombies out of the plane. Oliver took one deep breath and took off his backpack. Oliver jumped out of the plane. Yes. He jumped out of the plane.
        
        “What the! What are you doing!” Noah shouted. A zombie went right next to him without him realisingrealizing it since he was distracted. Charlotte quickly noticed it and called the plant to shoot the zombie. 
        “Don’t make my sacrifice go in vain, fellas. I will see you again before the world becomes a new world!” The zombies slowly piled on top of Oliver, and the plane engine roared even louder as it was about to take off. Jules looked and observed the situation for a quick moment, before shutting the door tight. The high schoolers seem shocked and sad at the same time. Luxury dropped to the floor. Steven, Bob, Xander, and Jimmy sat down on the seat with blank expressions on their faces. Charlotte teared up a little. 
        
        “Damn it!” Noah spoke in disappointment as he chucked his lightsaber on the ground.
        “Guys, let's not let his sacrifice go in vain,” Ethan spoke, as he stood tall in front of the plane.
        “Yeah guys, he had a point, let's survive this. Don’t make his sacrifice go in vain. It’s the best we can do for him.” Liam said, trying to reassure everyone. Everyone looked out the window as the plane was finally lifted into the air. In the distance, they could see and hear a small explosion go off.
        
        Elijah looked at the group who was not cheered up and thought for a moment, before shouting one final statement to hopefully cheer up everyone.
        “Lads, hope is ahoy, and America is AHOY!”
        
        Chapter 6- CDC
        
        Oliver sacrificed.
        Yup, he did that, for that bunch of teenagers. Sorrow spread around the room faster than the Amazon wildfire. All that was now heard was silence. Nothing, but silence.
        Just two minutes ago, everyone was alright. They made it out of the town full of zombies, made around the road and fought their way all the way to a plane to America, all in one piece, but someone just had to leave for the others to proceed
        Someone just had to sacrifice.
        
        Boom! Orange and yellow, now blinking with the sky, before a greygray cloud covered it all up into deep sadness. The explosion made Steven jump, before turning his head and looking back to where the sound came from. There was nothing. Just a large, dark greygray sky that seemed to cover the whole airport and the sky of the whole region.
        
        He is gone, confirmed by the explosion. He slowly sat back down. Liam, the guy that usually makes everyone all right, isn’t doing anything; he himself is shocked and scared and sad and disappointed and is currently suffering from emotional damage along with the rest. Elijah’s words don't seem to cheer them on, he looked at them in pity as he waited for an opportunity to spark hope again.
        
        It’s been only 3 days since the zombie apocalypse hit the world, and somehow, it made life look like a living hell. Panic and chaos had gripped the entire planet as people were running for their lives. No one knew how the virus had spread yet, but it had unleashed hell on Earth, and the world is no longer safe.
        
        Except that according to Jules's intel and devices, she had been able to confirm to their great relief, that the North-American continent is still safe, therefore that is their plan for now; to escape to America.
        After a whole hour, Elijah can’t take the silence anymore.
        
        “So what? He died for us to go on. He sacrificed.” Elijah started, everyone looked at him in anger, like he just betrayed them and left them to rot.
        “The point is, we have to carry on. He told us not to let his sacrifice go in vain. With his death, we use it to continue! So that we can survive! Without anyone else…” He stopped for a moment, realisingrealizing his mistake, and he tried to change the topic.
        “Let’s just get to Ameri…”
        “What did you want to say before? Say it! Without anyone what? Without anyone else Sacrificing! So what if we survive in America, what will happen then? I think that you are being greedy and wanting to survive for yourself!” Noah shouted, before stomping off into the backroom of the aircraft, tearing up.
        “Elijah, I know you just wanted to cheer us up, but, I don’t think there is really a way to, you know,” Liam spoke quietly, before heading off to find Noah. Elijah hung his head in shame as he wanted to cheer them up, but heit only feltfeel the gloomygloom in the room . What if another person has to sacrifice? He looked right to left, and stopped looking around just staring straight ahead.
        
        What if.
        
        Liam went and spoke to Noah.
        “Just get over it. Come out when you are ready.” Liam said without certainty, as a way to hold the group together, before heading back. Norman looks at the depressing teenagers. He can’t take it anymore; this is just slowing themselves down. They have to move on and get themselves together before they land.
        
        “Everyone get out here! Including you Noah!” He shouted across the plane. Noah was shocked for a second, before walking out of the backdoor, back to the main seating area. Norman flicked the switch to “Autopilot” and stood up in front of the main room, taking charge and standing strong.
        
        “This isn’t working at all! You guys just, I know that you guys are just nothing more than kids but get yourselves together. Everything is going to go back to Normal.”
        “Yeah! What about Oliver!” Noah shouted back, eyes still in tears as he took a seat and looked towards Norman sarcastically. Chloe looked over at Norman; she knew this wasn’t easy for him, not for anyone, yet he still had the courage to do so.
        “Because of one single death are you guys gonna give up on everything? What about your family, huh? What about your friends, what about your uncles, what about your pets, what about well, most importantly, home? A place you feel you belong? Yeah. Yes. The people might be turned into zombies and that’s why! We must not give up. We will turn everything back to Normal. We will drop you off in America and we will find the cure. So stop pulling us back and making us lose hope and faith! We will, and must, save Andle.” Norman finished his speech. He sighed and felt a little bit proud of himself, as he walked back and continued to steer the plane. The kids were left with eyes wide open and jaws hitting the floor after Norman’s speech. For once he might be right. Jimmy thinks in surprise. Noah, who seemed just like the grinch a moment ago, slowly brightened up and said “Sorry” to Elijah and the rest of the group. Thoughts filled his head in uncertainty. I had never thought about my family, the rest of my friends, and the world, now I am the one being very greedy.
        
        “Yeah. It’s just like a game of chess. Sometimes, you gotta sacrifice a piece to maintain your position and advantage.” Bob un-classifies, and this time, Steven gets it. But the thought of more people sacrificing kept circling in his mind.
        
        He pushed that thought to the back of his head and straightened up.
        
        “Let’s do this, let's land this plane!” Steven confirms his stand to the rest of the group with a glimmer of hope in his eyes and determination in his mind. Elijah looked at the now more brightened group and turned back to Norman, thinking: Who is this guy?!?! He’s a god!
        
        Soon, they’re approaching America, but little do they know that their plans would get ruined into nothing more than a pile of burning garbage.
        
        “Cabin crew prepares for landing,” Norman states through the microphone, just to let everyone on board know that they’re approaching America while trying to enlighten the mood. Everyone quickly got to their seats and buckled up. He flicks off the auto-pilot switch and turns on the seatbelt sign,safety is important, children.
        
        Charlotte, hoping to see something outside, opens the blinds, revealing a bright, shiny sun. The brightest they have ever seen in the past few days. Steven looks out at the opened blind and feels warm. They might be approaching the end. This might finally end peacefully and maybe just maybe, there’s a bit of hope to grasp onto till the end. They’re all enjoying the sun until Xander shouts ragingly.
        
        “Oh my god please pull down the blind the sun is turning my eyes into boiled eggs!” So, Charlotte pulled it back down.
        
        Jules looks down through the side pilot window; they’re directly on top of the border that stops the zombies. But just as she suspected, they’re too high; all you can see is the sun and the dense clouds that separate the light from the dark.
        
        Static sounds started to appear from the coms of the aeroplaneairplane, but it wasn’t until a full 10 seconds later that someone in America actually spoke through microphonically.
        “Good afternoon, Tower speaking. Please identify yourselves. Over”
        “We’re from Andle, Bombardier Global Express heading to port. On board, we have Commander Taylor and this is Pilot Norman speaking. We have 14 people in total and we wish to land as it is safe there. Over''
        “Can you assure us that there is NO ONE infected? Over”
        “Yes, we can. Over”
        “Waiting for confirmation, yes. Your landing has been WAIT!” Norman’s ears died for a second, as another voice which seemed to be an aged woman interrupted the microphone of the control tower.
        “As per the CEO and president of the CDC Foundation, Dr. Judith Monroe, to ensure the safety of the remaining survivors along with the confirmation from the president of the United States, the prime minister of Canada, and the president of Mexico, all flights towards North America have been temporarily restricted until further notice. Please go back to where you came from. By any means entering our premises is considered an offenceoffense to International Law and therefore can and will be prosecuted.” The CEO spoke firmly while trying to hide that she was nearly out of breath. They have been advised about a plane coming in, and they have to be cautious about it.
        
        Norman explained the situation to the rest of the group before turning the built-in aeroplaneairplane communications device back on. The CEO took a step back, as a group of people that was what heard like CDC personnel, approached and took over the situation. Steven can hear Norman’s desperate attempt along with his sweaty face as he tries to argue his way out of the situation, but the CDC personnel weren’t budging at all. They had to ensure the safety of everyone, and they would not allow any entries that would put others at risk.
        
        The group was not pleased with the interruptions. Their fuel tank was more empty than a rat’s stomach, as travellingtraveling from the Indian Ocean to the east side of America was a long distance. They need to come out with a solution soon, or they will meet their demise.
        
        They can’t turn back; they don’t have enough fuel to do so, or to land anywhere else except the North-American continent in fact. The closest point is Portugal, but even so would take more than 10,000 litresliters, when they only had less than a thousand litresliters to spare. Norman made one final attempt as he re-connected the device and explained their fuel condition, but the CDC personnel were not willing to take any chances, so he just cursed them before cutting them off.
        
        The commander looks at Norman, as he takes off his headset and turns down the communication system. They both nod at each other, and Norman slowly rotates the jet towards the opposite side. The group at the back looked confused, but Steven could tell whatever they were thinking off, and it was going to be risky. Jules also noticed; the nodding and that the two never give up, not even once, on her experience with them since the previous operation.
        
        “Are we just gonna turn back?” Ethan questioned.
        “Nope!” called out Norman’s wobbly voice as he told them to “Brace yourselves”.
        “Yeah stupid, do you think that they were gonna turn back!” Xander made one final say, as he mocked Ethan and the jet made one final rotation toward America. Ethan had a bad feeling about this, but trusts the adults that they will make the best decisions. They’re military adults with experience after all. Norman pulled out a red cover, switched on a switch, and pressed the big red button. Then the jet sped as fast as hell. 
        
        Going 2,000 kilometreskilometers an hour was the fastest anyone in the plane had been, including Norman who was piloting the plane, as it was supposed to be used only in an emergency, and by now, we all know this is an extreme one. Coloured lights flashed over them like they were going at the speed of light. A moment later, the plane slowly slowed down; Norman speaks into the microphone in a raspy voice; “Welcome … to America”
        
        “This is just like Star Wars and a spacecraft!” Noah with loads of adrenaline in his veins as he looks outside enthusiastically. On the opposite side, Luxury was nothing but a pile of flesh, like her soul just ascended . Ethan tried to get her up again, and it worked, she was back to normal in no time, and her face turned back to its original colour instead of being as pale and white as a ghost. 
        
        “Weak!” Xander mocks the two. No way am I going to let him take that.
        “Don’t call us weak, you couch potato, I bet that you’re so fat that big chungus is nothing compared to you!” Ethan took one final stand, as he stared hard directly at Xander.
        “You wanna go!” Xander stood up too, with eyes of hatred shining directly at him. The world’s greatest roasting battle was about to begin, with the great … yeah no, their fight was interrupted by a speaker through communications.
        
        “You had objected to international laws by entering the continent despite having been clearly rejected from us, the CDC, and on behalf of the presidents and prime ministers of the countries in the North-American continent. We now give you one last chance to turn back, or we will have the authority to shoot back!” 
        “How do they see us? We are supposed to be going into stealth mode! And how in the world did they hijack our coms?” Norman shouted to the rest in panic. The commander spoke one final statement before the war was declared.
        “You know what happens now.” She takes a big gulp and holds onto her will.
        
        The communications spoke, or should we say the CDC personnel.
        “Well, you asked for it, bye-bye.” And the speaker went silent. After a few seconds, a BOOM can be heard with some clanks on the roof of the plane, as the crew looked out of the window, they saw what was coming for them. Fighter jets were now chasing after them, firing trillions of bullets and lasers against them. Plane sirens were now heard from the inside; they were hit.
        
        “Mayday Mayday!” Norman shouts. Jimmy looks over to the right towards the wing through the window; the engine was going up in flames, they were going down.  They were diving as fast as a penguin directly down, directly towards underneath them. The group pulled their heads down with their hands covered in a brace position. However, nearby Ethan, he can see tears, dropping nearby him and a little whimper, coming from Luxury, and he had all rights to be surprised. Luxury usually looks intimidating and was assertive and loyal in class as what you would’ve expected to see as a class president. Ethan noticed her complete change when she got absolutely pale when speeding into America. She tries her best to hide herself and show to others about her strength and power when in reality, she was someone who can’t even take going very fast and revealed herself as someone who gets scared often. Ethan saw her change toward her scaredness and unusualness from school as he looked over at her face; it was like that phrase, she was a cat stuck on a tree.
        
        He grabbed her hand and held it firmly. Luxury looked over, as Ethan tried to be as confident as ever, gave her a smile, a wary one, but one that says ‘it’s not over’. To his surprise, she smiled back too. I am giving her the confidence she needs to survive this crash.
        Xander looked over, and he felt massive Emotional damage.
        
        The plane was going faster and faster, as it passed through the clouds and the sky turned dark and greygray from the light above the clouds. Norman tries to pull the brakes and tries to turn towards the forest, where hopefully the trees will reduce the impact. This is their only option since there were no lakes nearby.
        
        “Brace!” was the faint voice that Steven heard before everything blacked out. Now dear readers, what fate do you think if you’re Steven, will have to accept, do you see god, or do you thrive?
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Chapter 7- Do you Thrive
        
        The sky was dark
        
        It was Monday, what Steven thought would be a typical day where Steven would come into his usual meeting stop and hear ‘PRESS START’ booming from Elijah’s phone and Noah and E-man talk about space and then he and his friends had mathsmath. The first period turned out to be a complete disaster. 
        
        Who would’ve thought that zombies could swim?
        
        The sky was unusually dark in the morning as if it was nighttime when it was 9. Steven already sensed this danger, but the thought of it got the hold of him, so he just kept quiet.
        
        A zombie got on top of him and chewed him bit by bit. He just stared at the once human being feeding happily but depressedly on him.
        
        He wanted to scream, but nothing came out. His self-confidence and beliefs in the world that he built up since 3 have all fallen into nothing. 
        
        The reliever was screaming as loud as a firetruck about 100 metresmeters beside him. And the rest of his friends too, were half-dead, and sure enough, would turn into those green beasts as well.
        
        Steven feels intense stress until he can finally shout in a last leap of helplessness.
        
        “AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH”.
        
        “Steven! Steven! Don’t die on me!” 
        The image slowly disappeared, leaving nothing but pure darkness. Jimmy?
        
        Hope resignated as the darkness faded out, leaving a smoky background with his best friend Jimmy shaking him. Steven tried to get up, but what seemed like a long yet skinny metal stick that was part of the aircraft sliced through his thighs. He looked down at it and tumbled back to his usual spot. It isn’t meant to be like this. But thank the lord, he was alive.
        “Thank god you’re alive,” Jimmy spoke in relief and hovered over Steven to follow him. Steven pointed at his injured leg while trying to grasp oxygen. Blood was pouring out of it non-stop, as much as the tomatoes in a tomato farm. Jimmy noticed the blood, and his eyes dropped out in fear and shock.
        
        “Move away,” Norman told Jimmy, but Jimmy just stood there, half-shocked by the whole situation. Norman looked at Jimmy for one more second, in the hope of a response. But Jimmy was just frozen, like a person in a vegetative state. ‘Norman pushed him away and pulled his hand towards the exit, before flinging Jimmy off the plane like angry birds on a slingshot.
        
        Jimmy fell towards the grass and turned back to face the burning jet. He was sitting there, just sitting there, until Bob helped him up and the two ran towards the high ground, far away from the disastrous fire. Bob looked at the fire and thought, “I can’t fix it…”
        
        “Hold it!” Norman shouted, before pulling out the metal stick. Steven screamed hard in his lungs, but it was quiet to the others, he was just too scared and his energy was completely drained out to do so. Norman ripped a small piece of cloth out of his white shirt and tied it around Steven’s wound. The white cloth slowly turned red, but no blood was dripping out now. Steven manages to stand with the help of Norman and sees the whole situation inside the plane.
        
        To the left of the exit, were Jules and the commander, trying to get the last remaining supplies out of the plane with the help of Liam and Noah. And to the right, Steven just stared at what couldn’t be true; Ethan was just lying there, unconscious with what looked like glass pierced through his chest. It couldn’t be true right? Luxury was crying in distress while shaking Ethan. Charlotte tried to calm her down as she patted her shoulder while trying to hold in her tears. Her eyes were red as hell, mirroring the bloody fire that was rapidly growing.
        
        “You kids get out of here as soon as possible! It's going to explode soon!” Norman makes one final call, and Steven can no longer see his dead and sad friends. Norman placed Steven next to Bob and Jimmy, who helped Steven settle. Bob looked desperate, he wanted to go back and help. But Norman told him to stay put and help wave and settle the rest of the people in this safe zone.
        
        Chloe finished the last supply and hovered the kids inside and spoke the exact same things as Norman did; the plane has gotta explode soon so get out soon. Charlotte tried to convince and help Luxury to quickly settle the regret and bring her out, but Luxury was insistent and dominant. Xander stood by the door, looking directly at them, Elijah told Xander that he would get out first before Elijah hurried away. Xander can’t leave them. Enough people have sacrificed. He ran into the spot and pushed Charlotte aside.
        
        “Hey!” Charlotte shouted not loudly while blinking rapidly to stop her tears from flowing out.
        “We gotta move! What are you gonna do about him, huh? Just survive! That’s what he wanted anyways! Are you gonna bring Charlotte down with you? Just because of your stupid thinking!” Charlotte stopped complaining, and the small Luxury turned to look at the massive Xander, his shadow covering her up. He changed. Ethan was not breathing. At least not anymore, Luxury slowly got up, and the sound of the fuel burn roared louder than ever.
        
        BOOMoom! A small explosion beside them triggered their minds. Charlotte ran out towards where everyone was. Another small explosion was heard, and Norman started to run toward the jet again.
        
        What the hell are these kids doing? Xander pulled Luxury and they ran out of the plane, greeted by Norman, who turned back and ran back the moment he noticed them. Xander pants in sweat, with Luxury slowly falling behind. Xander slowed down for a few seconds for Luxury to catch up.
        
        “Come on! Run fasterfaste…” Another explosion, slightly larger, occurred behind them interrupting what Xander was about to say. And they fell to the ground. Norman, who was in front of them, turned and pulled them up to their stand. But it was no use, as the large explosion, probably the largest there’s gonna be, sploded the plane. Xander and Luxury got flung to the sky by the impact, while Norman slowly drifted back while holding his stance with his hands over his face.
        
        “I got you Ahh AHH!” Elijah hovered over Xander, hoping to catch him, but changed his mind at the last second after seeing Xander’s black shadow covering his whole body. “Oh dear lord may you save me from the pain I'm about to suffer” he prayed. The two clashed with the grassy lands beside them, as the sky was covered in the orange and grey sky.
        
        “Where is your other friend?” Jules questioned. 
        “Yeah, where is E-man?” Liam questioned. Hearing his name, Luxury started to cry again, and the group looked at Liam and Jules in disappointment.
        “He passed away,” Xander confirms and turns to look at the burning sky. Liam said nothing and turned back to the awful scenery. Steven couldn’t believe what he had feared worse would become a reality.
        
        He’s gone. Once again, someone sacrificed. Will there be someone else?
        
        “Wait, where’s Elijah?” Liam suddenly realized.
        “Oh no, TWO sacrifices?!?!, how could this get any wors-”
        “Xander, move your butt off me please?”
        To everyone’s surprise, Xander’s butt was talking, or was it? As Xander lifted up his butt, it revealed Elijah being as flat as a pancake. “I don’t think I’ll recover from this…”
        
        Flum! The flame roared again, this time louder. Norman hovered over the group to follow as he walked towards the other side, away from the burning jet.
        
        “Let’s go before the American government finds us.” Jules follows up with Norman’s gesture and walks. The kids followed, or what else they can do? Luxury looked back, and Charlotte convinced her again.
        
        “He thrived, more than any of us possibly,” Charlotte says, and slowly and lightly pulled Luxury back towards the rest.
        
        Suddenly, the sky brightened up. And waves of light and sounds of void and neon shone behind them. They turned back. Jules pulled out her glasses from her pockets and put them on in disbelief. The group was shocked. Norman looks at the extraordinary rays of light shining through a figure slowly rising through the burning red flame.
        
        Woosh! A ray of wind brushed through everything, and the fire turned to a blue, cool flame. Steven nearly trips by the powerful wind, but Jimmy pulls him as he is about to fall. Luxury’s eyes shined bluely as the blueness reflected on her. On everyone in fact. 
        
        “My cap!” Noah shouted as he ran to chase his cap that was blown by the wind.
        
        The figure rose high, and everything went blue with the insane wind pushing them. They tried to hold their stance against it, Steven was now seated after being pushed to the ground by the wind. 
        
        It was after seconds before the wind stopped. The figure was now standing in front of them, directly in front of Steven. Luxury cried in tears of happiness, slowly hazing up her glasses, while Bob smiled while trying to understand the logic behind this. The figure looks at Steven, standing tall and firm in front of him. Their eyes met, and Steven’s mind was blown away while Elijah was still a pancake. No way, … it couldn’t be, the entire group thought all at once.
        
        “Did you guys miss me?” Ethan spoke with a smile, then looked at the flat Elijah. Wow, what happened to you?
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Chapter 8- Out the GateKnock on Your Door
        
        What in the world the E-man is alive.
        
        Everyone stared at him in pure confusion. Of course everyone is confused. Just imagine seeing your friend die in front of you and then after an explosion and some winds, he is just standing in front of you. Yes, literally standing in front of you scratchless and asking “Did you guys miss me?”
        
        Noah was walking back towards them after getting his hat.
        
        “Damn, what a chase. Fellas I got my cap back!” He shouted from across. No one was listening to him, they were all looking at something towards the aircraft. He got confused and walked past them as he put on and adjusted his cap without really looking in front of him.
        
        “Hi, Noah!” Ethan waved.
        “Oh hi, E-man….. What what what!” Noah rubs his eyes in disbelief and takes a step backwards.
        “Ghost???” Elijah questions and flings off his slippers before holding them tightly in front of him.
        “... right behind you” Liam joined in to harass the tree, poor tree, what did he do to deserve this?
        “Please chill, it's just me!” Ethan tries to negotiate.
        “I think it's this.” He pulled out a black necklace chain that was hanging from his neck.
        “Obsidian.” Charlotte takes a step forward towards him, ignoring those idiots being cautious.
        “Let me have a look.” Ethan takes off the funny yet cool-looking necklace and passes it to Charlotte.
        “Be careful with it, it's my family’s heirloom.”
        “Of course!” She smiles and takes a closer look.
        “My family used to have one of these too, legend has it that the obsidians have been enchanted by the Chinese wizards of the west, dropped into a magical soup, and smeared it in unicorn poop..” She spoke, as she turned and twisted around a small smoothed ball of obsidian, with Ethan’s eyes twitching upon realizing he was carrying poo with him from his early childhood, …What-.
        
        “We will talk about this later, let's just go first before the Americans spot us.” He said and indicated them towards the forest below them at an angle. On the far side, they could see the end of it; a large foggy city.
        “New York City.” Noah points out.
        “Yes, the venture around the jungle should take us a couple of hours, just what we needed to keep away from the military and the CDC.” Norman justifies and looks at Steven.
        “Can you still walk?”
        “Yes, I think,” Steven replies, and off they go. Get yourself together, Steven.
        “For goodness sake, Ejilah, Liam, stop being flat-headed knuckleheads and get over here” Xander screamed.
        
        The forest got denser and denser by the coming minute until they were fully inside the surprisingly dark forest with no sunlight at all shining in. They’re led by Jules, who’s using a small some sort of GPS device. Xander looks at Ethan in somewhat relief and just hovers over beside him to poke him.
        
        “Okay, just confirming that you are not a ghost.” Xander laughs and moves in front of them to where Elijah is. Luxury caught up beside Ethan. And have a chat with him.
        
        “I never see you wear that necklace.” Luxury questions unknowingly.
        “Well, I just wore it inside. It is lucky that I wore it today.” Ethan replies and looks at the obsidian that seems to be glowing a little since his revival, probably just the poop, as Ethan’s face crumbled up in disgust...
        “I am just glad that you are fine. E-man,” She chuckles and turns to look at him; she has to turn her head up to meet his eye, he is rather tall and she is rather short.
        “Yeah. I mean like, I did hear my parents say something about it as well.” He turns to Charlotte, who is walking in front of him.
        
        “Where’s yours now?” He asks Charlotte, who turns back after a few seconds of delay as if she was thinking about something.
        “What? Oh, It's in our safety box in the bank.” She replies and carries on thinking something until she finally asks the question to Ethan.
        
        “Do you know when and how your parents got it?”
        “My parents tell me nothing 'cause I never asked actually, why?” Ethan uno reverses the question. Charlotte doesn’t seem surprised at all, as she has already expected Ethan to reply to that answer, and she answers as if she just cares about her statement.
        
        “It's just that I think I overheard my parent's conversation with my grandparents about this a few years ago. I don’t really remember the whole thing, but I think that I remember that it has something to do with China’s gifts of peace centuries ago when they first settled in Andle.” Charlotte summaries, before they started to walk faster to catch up with them; the conversation and thinking seemed to be slowing down their footsteps.
        
        “Well, that makes sense that both of our families have it since we are both long-time natives back in Andle.” Ethan makes a final statement, before turning back to Luxury and chatting with her.
        Charlotte was still deep in thinking but never realisedrealized that she was walking rather fast now. She looks forward to quickly realisingrealizing Steven limping through with the help of Jimmy and Bob and slows down her pacing. By now, Charlotte would have noticed that Steven just turned himself into sweat soup, he was sweating loads, bucketloads of sweat for a hike like this. They try to take the safest tracks where the light is still visible instead of complete darkness. Even so, Norman has to take a flashlight to allow the others to see tens of metresmeters ahead.
        
        They took the shortest amount of breaks and stops possible to reach New York by the evening, so they would have time to do stuff before everything was closed and would be able to see at least a bit of the light in this dense forest. Steven endures his pain and limps as fast as he can. Come on Steven. Come on!
        
        …
        
        “Wowzers!” Bob says.
        
        The city glimmers with its bright signs and massive skyscrapers. The sunset glowed with a perfect twilight blend as beams of neon lights and pop music were blasting loudly. The feeling of high life was in the air.
        
        Finally, after hours of hikes, they arrived at the location they were thinking about arriving at. The place where it is safe and livable.
        
        They are on the North American plate. They are in America. They are in New York, one of the world’s largest cities. They are safe. Now let’s have fu-
        
        “Let’s get ourselves cleaned up first. Steven, I will take you for a checkup in the hospital and everyone else follow the commander and Jules and get yourselves changed.” He said while looking at the scratched and unclean clothing that everyone among them was currently wearing. They look nothing more than peasants in Blackbeard’s ship. Some other people are staring at them in suspicion and confusion, and Norman’s way of cleaning it up should be rather effective to blend in.
        
        “What about money?” Luxury asked. Others think that it was a very good question. What about money?
        
        “Welllllllll, the government funds,” Chloe said proudly and took out her credit cards and passed them out to them.
        
        “Meet back here at exactly 6 for dinner.” Norman clarified, and they went on each of their ways.
        
        Steven went to the doctor with Norman, and he got bandaged up very quickly. The doctors here are fast. Steven thought as he walked out of the Hospital.
        
        He stared at the clock that was hanging in front of a shop. 4:45, He reads, and his jaws drop. It only took half an hour. Together, they walked past stores and fashion stores to hopefully find something to get changed. With the City so big, they got lost a few times and were just looping in circles. 
        
        “We should’ve gotten Jules's GPS device, I am sure that she has a spare.” Norman regrets it, and they continue walking. Just walking, turning to places and streets that they’ve never turned into before. Until they stopped in front of what looked like a megamall.
        
        “Surely, right?” Steven pants, half exhausted.
        “Yeah hopefully, let's check it out.” Norman hovers in towards the mall. Steven follows one more step before something to his right catches his eye; A shining silver-blue katana in a glass-protected box with a sign that says “Atomsplit Katana”. It wasn’t the katana, it was the 90% discount flag. He stared at the poor unwanted katana shining brightly despite the isolation, demonstrating a glimpse of hope despite the abandoned feel.
        
        “Come on!” Norman yells at him over, and he comes.
        
        “Wow!” Bob exclaims the same exact one-word phrase again. What looked like thousands of outfits were hung and presented around the store. From brightly coloured dresses to black and Npesta white T-shirts. They selected different outfits no matter the price. Luxury was happy once again with the limitless cash they got from “government fund”. Eh, should not matter now anyway that the country is gone. FOR NOW.
        
        “Luxury should wear Luxury branded outfits!” Ethan Jokes and they all laugh, except for Xander, who is in the fitting room and Charlotte who is deep in thought about the obsidian.
        “Thank you, E-man.” Luxury finishes.
        
        “Are you kids all done?” The commander questions. She was with Jules, each wearing bright-coloured outfits with jeans.
        “I don’t think that we can be called kids after all we’ve been through.” Bob deflects, before walking up to the counter and purchasing his outfit.
        “That makes sense, where do you all want to go after this? We have another hour to spare,” Chloe corrects herself with a question, and Charlotte replies instantly.
        “Library, gotta find some information.” She justifies, and Elijah responds with a mournful response immediately.
        “The LiLaRBaRy, what about we buy something epic, like …” He looked around “... that e-scooter, 2% off! We can buy millions!” ”
        “Furthermore, we need transportation sooner or later. And we need to look like the MythBusters on their way to bust a myth” Liam takes Elijah’s side.
        
        “You guys can go there, who’s following me to the library? I happen to have some information that I needed to find out about this continent.” Jules decides. Why not go to both places simultaneously?
        “I will help you find information.” The commander confirms her assistance, before turning towards Elijah and Liam.
        “You kids, I mean guys, be safe okay? And meet in time for dinner, we gotta get you guys somewhere to stay temporarily.” The commander clarifies the point of a dinner gathering and starts walking out of the mall.
        
        “Xander! Are you coming with us?” Elijah shouts towards the changing rooms. Everyone is staring at him now, like some sort of psycho freak.
        “Oops, a bit loud.” But in reality, he finds this happening every day. Elijah looks over at the fitting room, hoping for a reply and yes, a reply is sent.
        “Yessir!” Now everyone has their eyes on that one spot in the fitting room.
        “I don’t know you guys.” Liam held his hands out towards Elijah, but they both knew that it was a joke, and they grinned like they just found a way to get infinite money, but now they had actually found a way…
        
        “What about you E-man?” Elijah questions his other friends, who seem to be walking out with the commander.
        “I gotta find out about the weird Obsidian too.”
        “Bob?” 
        “I can help. I want to help them find stuff.” Bob hesitates for a second, before waving at them as he hurries towards the commander and E-man, who's walking with Jules, Charlotte, and Luxury who's walking in between Ethan and Charlotte.
        
        “And I’m definitely coming with you guys!” Noah exclaims, everyone seems to have forgotten about his existence for a moment.
        “Where’s Jimmy?” Liam questions, before just realisingrealizing that he’s with them, going to the boring library.
        “He says that he wants to know what really happened in the past about something. Something personal he says.” Noah answers Liam, which settles everything. They have split up into two groups, one going to the library, and the other going to the e-scooter dealership.
        
        …
        
        They are in front of the massive library, which seems to be called the New York Public Library as they walk past flyers. Make sense. Bob thinks. 
        
        They entered through the main hall and just as expected, it was as quiet as a mouse, except for the massive typing that seemed to be going on for the other room; must be the computer room. “97% NO, NO, NO AWWWWW!” Yep, definitely the computer room.
        
        They walked up the giant stairs onto what seemed like an archive room. It was empty, fully empty, just like what they would’ve expected too; no one ever needed to read through the archive, they just went on computers. And just as they expected, a large sign on the left wall has a text stating “Archive room.” Damn, New York is really predictable isn’t it?
        
        This is going a bit too smoothly, everything is going just as expected. Is it just me, or is our luck going to change later? It’s just we’re too lucky. Bob was deep in thought, until E-man, or Ethan called him over.
        
        “It's somewhere here, right?” Charlotte questioned. Jules and the commander had headed toward the geography section, leaving behind only Ethan, Charlotte, Luxury, and Bob to investigate the mysterious Obsidian.
        “Yeah, it should be, it says magic and trades history in Asia,” Luxury confirms, pointing to the sign on top hanging down from the white, untouched ceiling. 
        
        They walked through the grey patterned carpet without making a sound. Not on purpose, just the environment makes it seem like it was a polite thing to do, it is a library after all, and also, the librarian doesn’t seem too friendly. After a while, they split up, each trying to help find information about the obsidian to answer their many thoughts and questions; Where is it from? What is it used for? How is magic possible? How did it revive Ethan? Could it save the world and the situation that everyone is in right now? What’s for dinner? -Probably not the last one.
        
        Bob stumbled across a book with the title “Magic Book, flip to any of the pages without cheating to reveal your fate.” Hmm. He flipped it over to a random page and there was nothing but 3 lines of text; The quick brown fox leaps over three generations of hyperthermia trauma into a black dark hole. Be the most careful you can ever be. Choose your destiny but helping might bring consequences.
        
        What in the world? He quickly shut the book tight and placed it back on the shelf. Must be some weird Elijah-like joke, don’t worry Bob. Don’t worry…
        
        He continued searching for minutes along with the others, until they were on their last shelf
        “Well, here goes nothing.” Ethan breathes, and they flick through the books on that old but untouchably clean wooden shelf.
        
        From luckiness to unluckiness, they didn’t find what they wanted to find. Luxury adjusted her uncracked glasses and pulled her hand out to read her watch.
        “It's 5:40, we better go meet up with the others now.” She says passively. She turned behind her towards the stairs, and together they walked down, disappointed about today's achievement.
        
        They were greeted by Jules and Chloe when they arrived at the bottom floor. Jules can see their disappointed faces and tries to cheer them up.
        “Guess you guys didn’t find what you guys wanted to find, you can try the computers tomorro–…”
        
        A loud knock was heard from the door behind the main counter. Jules was interrupted by it and tried to carry on.
        “What I was saying is, you should still be here for a while, you can try again tomorro–o…” She was cut off again just when she wanted to say tomorrow again. This time, it was more like a bang, instead of a knock. Bob looked around and realisedrealized, where’s Jimmy?
        
        Jimmy was running, he had exited the library ages ago after finding the information he needed, and he was mind-blown by what he found; Norman was not lying, They died to causes that were irrelevant to Norman’s Uncle.  And Norman’s uncle did die, yet he was framed as a murderer. They sacrificed.
        
        He started to feel bad for Norman for his uncle getting framed as a cover-up by the government. The zombie chased after him, the city was in full frontal chaos. He bumped into Elijah and the others, who seemed to be working on something contrasting the chaotic environment.
        
        “A little help please?” Noah screamed over, and Jimmy went to do so.
        
        …
        
        No time to think about it, he should be fine. Bob turned back to the loud knock. The counter lady stood up and walked towards the door, all drained of energy. She twisted the door. The door opened, and she let out the most horrifying ear-piercing, blood-curdling scream ever, like the time Jimmy saw a big fat baboon in his face when it was just a cardboard picture.
        
        Everyone changed their attention to the door, where the lady was on the floor, pleading for help. It was not until a second that happened, that the flashlight blinked and sounds of alarms were sounded across the room on people's phones, it was an alert. But it's too late and delayed.
        
        The zombie pressed towards the lady and was munching her into nothing more than tiny atomic bits. The commander went to fight, but before she could do anything, hundreds more approached. They were too late, the alerts were too late, and they were nearly helpless.
        
        Nearly, but not yet. They were not consumed by zombies yet. They need to find a way out.
        
        The whole library went into full panic. People were running from corner to corner, door to door, hoping to find a way out with their hands up. Some people were throwing books at the undead, which seemed to work, but only for one or two. The zombies were chewing the people mercilessly as the force got bigger and bigger, and was closing fast. If they don’t do something quickly, they’re zombies.
        
        Is this what I was feeling? We were way too lucky then. This is what I was feeling, the unluckiness that comes after the over-luckiness. Is this what the book warned me about too? Be the most careful you ever can. 
        
        Bob was still deep in thought before he realisedrealized something more important. How did they even get past the North American continent? But then he remembered that the Zombies can swim from the Middle East to Andle in 2 days, which is about 3,000kms so….
        
        “There’s no time for thoughts, Bob.” Ethan looked over at him, he could tell that he was thinking about something, and carried on.
        
        “Let’s do the thinking later, let’s get out of here first.” 
        
        
        Chapter 9- It is Of Course Underneath
        
        "I got a plan," the commander said, pointing to a small vent beside a bookshelf.
        "Yeah, we might be able to fit through," Jules confirms, before getting a drill out and slowly hovering toward the vent. The others follow, keeping their backs on each other and using the Nerf weapons to push back the zombies. The zombies were dense, but they needed to store time by just deflecting the zombies, even a few seconds would stop them from becoming those munchies. Jules drills the screws one by one as fast as she can. Luxury opened the small shoulder bag she found in the warehouse, revealing the heads of the small plants, which started to shoot too.
        
        But what could you expect, NYC is very dense and crowded. To the point that even the flame pea shooter was useless. The plants were getting exhausted, they forgot to feed them water the first thing they arrived. More and more of them are approaching, circling the library. They seem stronger, a lot stronger than the ones they met in school. Bob soon realisedrealized this, but just as Ethan told him, there was no time to think right now, so he just focused on grinding those darn green flesh eaters using his toy Assault Rifle.
        
        “Hurry up!” Luxury screams Jules, before closing the bag where the tired plants were in. Noticing her actions, Charlotte compromised in front of Luxury, kicking and shooting the zombies.
        
        “Give me three seconds!” Jules yelled while getting the drill out of one and putting it in the last screw. In a flash, the drill started spinning along with making construction noises.
        “Idonthinwehaveeventwosecondsnow!” Ethan shouted with very fast words that you can’t really understand. The zombies were towering over them, and Bob was using his gun to stop the zombies from coming with all his might like a barricade, as they were too close to fire now. Besides, they’re running low on bullets.
        “Done!” Jules shouted, before flinging off the metal just over to the towering zombies, nearly hitting Ethan, who was at the very front lines.
        
        “GO!” Chloe shouted, holding back the zombies. Bob threw his gun at the closest zombie which pushed it away for a small distance. He quickly crawled into the vent, following Charlotte and Jules. 
        “You two follow me quickly okay!” Chloe spoke firmly and crawled in behind Bob without looking back.
        
        Everyone has gone into the vent, he is the only one left trying to stop the zombies. After making sure the Luxury was crawling in, he pushed the zombies one final time before turning and crawling. ZZZZZ! It has happened. Ethan felt a pain in his leg, like teeth were being pierced into it. He looked down and saw the zombies’ final attack, that darn zombie bit his leg. He pulled the leg up and kicked it, despite the lack of space, and carried on crawling. Wondering what all the noise is about, Luxury twists her head back a bit and finds Ethan following right behind her.
        
        Ethan pushes Luxury in indication to go in, so she does after a millisecond of hesitation. Once she was fully in, she checked if Ethan was still behind her back.
        “Keep going quickly!” Ethan tells her. When she wasn’t looking at him, he covered a bite mark that was on his leg by tearing off a small part of the new shirt that was now covered in dust and dirt and tying it to the wound.
        
        I will tell them when we get to temporary safety, I will tell them to kill me if we ever get to the point it's necessary. The mark was bleeding rapidly, leaving a trail of red in the vent, as he crawled behind the team, feeling hesitant and unsure. He tears out another piece of cloth from the other sleeve of the shirt and ties it to cover the red cloth that was covering the bite mark. This time, it stopped, but inside, Ethan was still feeling uncertain and scared, not to mention the pain of something biting a piece of flesh off him.
        
        After a while, they finally reached the exit, which led them to the outside, where everything was in chaos. Helicopters and jets were flying all over the place, attacking and dropping small bombs. What used to be a beautiful sunset turned into this cloudy and dark foggy night. Screaming was heard from all over the place, and panic spread like wildfire, it was everyone for themselves. People were all over the place, trying to seek shelter and running to hopefully find safety, while some others got their own weapons and fought back instead of running away to defend their homeland.
        
        Bob wanted to help them, he really did. Ethan, who seems to be somehow reading Bob’s thoughts stops Bob from thinking too much and feeling depressed.
        “Let’s mind our own business first, where are we going now?” Ethan questioned.
        
        Jules got to her phone.
        “It's no time to be playing on your phone right now Jules!” Chloe said. Jules flicked through for a few seconds before saying: “Port, Norman wants us to meet at the port, He was with Elijah and the others.”
        
        …
        
        Steven was running alongside Norman, trying to get out of the underground back towards the main ground to find a signal to contact The others. They were underground purchasing and changing their rotten clothes, and then the phones of the people from all directions rang in an emergency.
        
        They ran up the stairs, instead of taking an elevator, because many people were trying to squeeze in the elevator as they probably forgot that fire exits are here for a reason. There were only a few people who were running in front of them, as they drifted from left to right, overtaking them, until they finally reached the ground floor. 
        
        Zombies were all over the place, biting and slowly infecting everyone. So, they run. Despite the pain in his leg, he ran asran, as fast as he could with Norman. I can’t die like that, not until I make sure everything is back to normal and everyone is safe. Norman looks at Steven and for once, realisesrealizes how tough these kids are.
        
        They were back to the entrance, and Steven once again saw the silver blue shining katana, only this time the label had come out and the glass was broken apart, leaving small sharp pieces of glass all over the floor. The store’s light was the only thing that separated everything from the darkness of the streets, as dense clouds hovered over them, signalling the end of safety.
        
        “Wait,” Steven says and runs over to the store to pick up the abandoned Katanna. Norman stops and turns toward a small isolated corner, as he grabs out his phone. Perfect timing, Jules was calling over from the other side, and he picked it up. 
        
        Steven grabs the katana in amazement, the blade was nicely cut out without a single scratch; he had wanted one of these in the past. He pulled out the shining sword of emblems. It would be logical to take one of these, it is not too sharp, so it can attack zombies, therefore it might be useful judging that I don’t have my shotgun that I lost during the crash. He pulled off the sheath of it and tied it to his backpack. With a little grin, he taunted the zombies and said ‘Come and get me’ and the zombies threw themselves at him. He swung the katana at the zombies, straight at their necks. Heads flew and bodies fell, his senses felt a presence behind him and he swung the katana backwards, killing the sneak attackers. He was ruthlessly finishing off the wave of zombies and in no time, they slowly disappeared from existence. He grips the katana surprisingly tight despite the sweat on his palms. It is surprisingly empty now, the zombies must’ve moved toward the east to find more people to feed on.
        
        In the distance, something came approaching, fast. Steven placed his sword out and held it tightly, unable to know for certain if it was a friendly or a foe. Steven shook a little, but not too much that makes it seem obvious. I mean, who isn’t scared of the unknown?
        
        Norman stares at the figure, no, many figures get larger and larger as he places the phone by his right ear. Using his other hand, he slowly grabbed the rifle that was placed behind him in his backpack. Just grabbed it though, and didn’t take it out. Just in case it’s a foe.
        
        Well, it’s not. Elijah appeared first to be standing on what looked like a modified E-scooter that had a Nerf gun attached to it at the front. He was followed by Xander, Noah, Jimmy, and Liam, each having their own modified E-scooter. Norman realisedrealized and released his hand from the gun.
        
        “They’re with me, Elijah, and the others,” Norman spoke over the phone and later hung up. Steven loosens the grip on his Katana and welcomes them.
        
        “Thank god you guys are alright,” Elijah smiles and hops off his electric scooter. How in the world did they get this? Steven was shocked, and Elijah quickly caught on.
        
        “Uhh well you are probably wondering about this, but well you see, it's a funny story….” Elijah was quickly interrupted by Norman, who seemed to have something urgent to say.
        “Let’s get to the port. It is no longer safe here, or anywhere. You fellas are coming with us to the middle-east, to find a solution to this ongoing problem. You guys are coming with us to take a ship into the Underneath and put a stop to this whole mess,” Norman said assertively and started to walk west, where the port is. Steven can see a figure of the port at a distance despite the fog and concludes that it is not that far. Steven walks alongside Norman but is stopped by Elijah.
        
        “One of you can hop behind me and one of you can hop behind Jimmy, I think that it is more efficient,” Elijah spoke calmly.
        “Norman, you can hop on with me if you want, my E-scooter is slightly bigger than theirs,” Jimmy told Norman in a voice that made it seem like he was fine with it but basically his mind was still swearing every word known to mankind. Norman’s mind presses its pause, something ain’t right button. It happened, a step for reconnection. He was overjoyed, beyond happiness and he was out of this world, heck even this universe, but he smiled at him. He talked to me in a normal conversation without trying to attack our past. I guess this is progress.
        
        “Sure.” Norman agreed and stood behind him on the E-scooter. Steven hoped on too, and they were ready to head towards the port.
        “Hold on tight!” Elijah said as he wore a pair of sunglasses he found in a $2 store. If you know Elijah well, you would know in this situation, the drift king is back bois.
        
        The motors were roaring, wrists were stretching, Eggman’s still eating. Elijah took a deep breath, “3, 2, 1, GO!”. ZOOM, went Elijah as he broke through the doors, shattering them, thousands of pieces of glass scattering. In an instant, all their heads were being tugged by all that wind resistance. However, it wasn’t over, speed increased as he leaned in for a jump of his life. The wheel marks started to make sparks and black trails were left. Then, there it was, just before a crowd of zombies, there was a sharp ramp. A sneaky grin grew on his face, but everyone knew what that would mean, and it wasn’t going to be pleasant. They were launched into the air, flying epicly over all the hungry green lads at the bottom. “Pose for the camera, guys!” But many were simply just trying not to fall off the scooter.
        
        They drifted past tens of abandoned buildings. There were still some zombies lurking around the streets, but they had no time to fight these small fries, they need to get to the spawn point, they need to find a cure, they need to save humanity, and in order to do those, they need to get to Underneath. So they just ignored them and drove faster. Going at 60 km/h, even the fast zombies can’t keep up with them, let alone the slow ones. Steven was grabbing onto Elijah tightly, as the air resistance constantly blew past them. “CCAAAAALLLLLMMMMM DOOOOOWWWWNNNN EEELLLIIIJJAAHHH!” Liam exclaimed.
        
        In less than five minutes, they arrived at the port, where the commander was waiting for them. Steven noticed that she is the only one there. So he hopped off the electric scooter and questioned her about the existence of other people. His questions were answered almost instantly, but not by her.
        
        “Found a ship! It's the only one!” Jules yelled from across the dock. Steven turned right and saw some light that was just lit up; he could see a ship, a massive ship. Big enough to fit all of them and all other stuff like supplies. Ethan was waving at them from the ship.
        
        While waving, Ethan’s cloth came off, revealing a horrible-looking bite that blood was slowly coming out of, the skin surrounding the wound had turned into a disgusting green colour. Ethan looked over to where Steven and the others were and was relieved for a second, as they were too far away to see such a detail. He bent down to grab the fallen cloth and tied it around the wound. “OH CRAP!” oh no… Once he got up, he noticed Xander, looking at the wound in dire shock. He turns towards Ethan from the wound, eyes wider than his stomach, covering his mouth with an awe expression as he backs away slowly. 
        
        Luxury approaches from behind Xander.
        
        “What’s wrong?” She questions. Xander realisesrealizes her behind and returns to normal.
        “It's nothing. Ethan just showed me a magic trick” Xander says while looking at Ethan, his expression contrasting his feelings. Ethan had been bitten. He is going to turn into a zombie. No one can know yet, we can’t let everyone go into a panic. I know that he has a plan. I trust him. No, I need to trust him, I can’t let Luxury worry too.
        
        “We will talk about this later.” Xander finishes and walks back to the front to welcome the rest with his mind filled with thoughts. Thanks, Xander. Thanks for keeping it a secret for now. Maybe you're a good fella. Ethan forces and smiles and approaches Luxury.
        “Let’s go and discuss what to do for now that everyone is here.” He said and led the way with Luxury following him.
         
        …
        
        “Okay, let’s split up to find the key. Norman, you, Jules, and Steven can remain in the boat and try to understand how to drive it. Since Steven's legs are injured too and can’t really help us as it requires walking. Luxury and Ethan, you two can go to search at the small office over there,” Chloe points to the small doubled-story building. Steven suffers emotionally for a second, only a second as he must admit; he can’t do much with an injured leg, so he should focus on a quick recovery. Ethan interrupts, which is unlike him.
        
        “Xander can come with us,” Ethan said assertively. Luxury looked over at Ethan with a flat face and eyes twitching, basically, an expression that said “What in the sussy among us did you just say?” Xander agreed almost immediately, leaving Luxury more confused than ever. They look at the two in curiosity; it is too unlike them, even Norman, Chloe, and Jules who had just known him for more than 8 hours, knew that something was off. But what can you say? People can change even if it is the two most likely people to start a nuclear war against each other.
        
        “Okay. Elijah, Noah, Liam, and Jimmy you guys go around the ship through the rooms to see if you can find the key, and finally, Bob and Charlotte, you two help me with supplies.” The commander finishes off, and they head to work.
        
        Bob looks at the modified E-scooter and is very impressed.
        
        “Wow, tape does fix everything.” He feels the tape for a while, before getting on it. Charlotte and Chloe each got one too, and they went towards a store in front of the dock, which was less than a minute away from them.
        
        …
        
        Xander, Ethan, and Luxury got into the building and switched on the lights. The couches and tables seem uninterrupted by what’s outside and are still in perfect condition. Xander looks right and notices a small room with some keys hanging on the wall.
        
        “Luxury, you go and check if one of those keys is for our ship. Remember, it is the one with a number that is 0317.” Ethan told Luxury, after realisingrealizing what Xander was thinking and looking at. RealisingRealizing the room, Luxury enters it without hesitation, leaving the two of them in the isolated room alone.
        
        Once Xander makes sure that Luxury is gone, he questions and has that conversation with Ethan.
        
        “What was that!” Xander’s horrifying expression came back. He is scared out of his pants, feeling uncertain and unpalatable for what’s to come.
        “I got bit while trying to escape through the vent with the others. Thanks for keeping it a secret.” Ethan thanks.
        “I won’t keep it a secret for long, so what are you going to do?” Xander asks while being scared deep down for the answer.
        “Kill me when I run wild, kill me when I turn into one of them.”
        “What about the obsidian? Can’t it save you?” Xander points at the obsidian that Ethan is wearing.
        “I don’t think it can save me from becoming a zombie. Besides, it is too risky as we can’t find any information on it while in the library. I would rather someone else have it to save humanity.” Xander has nothing to say about that but feels horrible. Despite that he dislikes Ethan, he is still a friend who hangs out with him every day at break and doesn’t want him to die; especially die in his hands.
        
        “Found it!” Luxury walks towards them in joy, holding the key high in her hands like a hard-earned medal.
        “Good, now let’s return to the ship and tell everyone,” Xander says, and they start walking a step. 
        
        Just a single step, before cracking sounds were starting to be heard from Ethan.
        
        Xander takes a step back, pushing Luxury back along with him. One of Ethan’s feet twisted backwards, and Luxury gasped. Xander knew what this meant, even with feelings of worry and pressure, it was now or never. So goes nothing….
        
        “He … He got bit,” Xander sorrowfully said. Luxury, upon hearing the news, pupils are smaller than a spectacle of dust, and tears start rolling down her cheeks. “No…E-man..” She holds close to Xander, who looks at Ethan in feelings of despair, a great friend and an epic roast opponent, turning slowly into a zombie, soon they might need to kill him. Those thoughts made his heart race faster than a horse race. 
        Another crack and Ethan was holding onto a pole. He coughed out blood and he said, in his breaking voice “Q-quick, w-warn the others, I-i’m so sorry.”
        
        Then for the first time in all history, a bulb of water left Xander’s eye, and another, and then another, one by one. His cheeks were as red as a rose while he took slow, deep breaths.
        
        Luxury sobs and moves closer to Xander, as they watch as their friend slowly loses himself. “It can’t be, what about the obsidian…”
        “I-it might not work, it’s too- it’s too risky-” He coughs out some more blood. His arms start to turn green as he yelps in pain. It won’t be long.
        
        “D-do what you must, f-for the group” Ethan stammers, he looks at Xander with eyes glimmering with his final hopes, “W-warn them, k-kill me”. Ethan’s eyes started to close, he was at his limit. Xander takes a step forward and reaches out for him. The pain of losing a loved one, it crushes your soul. Losing tens of them, your soul is broken in half. The journey leading here was filling him with pain and sorrow as he watched them, one by one, sacrificing and dying, it was unbearable. It was unbearable even for Xander.
        
        Ethan wobbles a bit, his will being drained slowly. His legs crack once more, and he falls to the ground.
        
        “NO!” Xander shouts, barely lifting himself up before running straight to him and trying to help him delicately.
        “Don’t die! Don’t you dare die on me! Stay strong Ethan! I’m so sorry for everything horrible I did to you. We’ll save you somehow. Just don’t di-"
        "H-Hey, hey, d-don’t be sorry, t-those were some good times, t-thanks man….” Ethan says, his dying voice fading slowly. It was hopeless, and Xander knew it too, Ethan wasn’t saveable, he couldn’t do anything about it. All he can do is watch, as his friend slowly turns into a mindless being. Luxury, as she saw this situation unfold, that glint of hope disappeared and she fell to her knees with Xander nearby, tears making puddles on the ground. “X-Xander, c-can you do me, o-one l-last f-favour?” Ethan said with a weakened smile as he slowly gave in to the infection. Xander, trying to hold in his tears, nodded once, reassuringly. It was enough. He used his now green hand to take off his family heirloom and the obsidian plops on the ground. “T-take it…” 
        
        With no hesitation, Xander takes the obsidian necklace. He looks at it; its dark colour shines into his eyes contrasting its surprisingly smooth texture. It was the last piece of Ethan left, the last of his hope. He closed his palm, he will hold it, hold it on until the end, hold it on until it’s over… He looks at his friend, as the last of him starts to turn green. He gathered his tears and placed his hand on his hair. As he whispered in his green ear.
        
         “Thanks, E-man.” He smiles with wet eyes.
        
        Ethan smiled at him, he felt no pain for a second, just inner warmth. He called me E-man.
        
        “Thanks for calling me E-ma-” 
        
        His whole body turned a full 360 around, realisingrealizing that Xander wouldn’t kill him, he knew what he had to say. He gathered all this remaining strength and shouted like the king of the jungle itself.
        
        “GO!”
        
         Xander and Luxury immediately got to their feet. Luxury promised from the bottom of her heartbroken soul, that she is determined to find a cure. And off they went.
        As they ran, Xander heard his name being called one more time. Whispers from his soul heard Ethan’s voice…
        
        Xander turned around, after pushing Luxury out to the front of the building.
        
        “Xans … t-take good care of her.”
        
        Xander looked at him, saluted with a serious face trying to assure Ethan, and said “I won’t let you down” and off he went.
        
        And that was the end, the E-man was gone…
        
        Ethan runs towards the wall with his last piece of mind to possibly stun himself to give them more time to run
        
        
        …
        
        They weren’t looking back, just running forward.
        
        “What’s going on?” Bob was in front of the two, who were just running without looking back.
        
        Bob’s face was just filled with complete confusion but quickly caught up to the situation. Xander pulled Bob and Bob nearly tripped, but quickly got back on the pace and ran with them full of regrets. I should have helped him. I should’ve listened to the book and been careful.
        
        Cause Ethan is truly gone this time
        
        Luxury waves the key as they ran and they ran on the boat. Everyone else stopped what they were doing and ran up the ship. Norman grabbed the keys and twisted them. In one instance, the ship came alive.
        “Yes!” Norman cheered.
        “Where’s Ethan?” Steven realisesrealizes his disappearance. Hearing his name, Luxury cries again, and Xander tries to calm her down.
        
        No. 
        It can’t be.
        No way he is.
        No way he is truly gone this time.
        No way that someone else.
        No way that someone else has sacrificed.
        
        “Let’s go.” Norman sighs, and the ship starts to move away from the dock.
        
        Chloe looks at the teenagers and this time, actually admits that Jules was right in her thoughts, they were not kids anymore, they had been through too much to call them that; loved ones were dead, and the whole world was on the brink of collapse. They were not kids, they were not adults, they were soldiers. Soldiers who survived when most people couldn’t, Soldiers who saw blood and saw the weight of death. Soldiers who went through too much to be considered kids. They earned my respect.
        
        Steven looks out the back window and there he sees it. It is now a reality. On the dock, a figure appeared. And it shattered Steven’s heart into a thousand pieces. He looked at the figure, as he placed his hand on the window, as a final goodbye, to his good friend.
        
        Ethan, walking out, as a zombie
        
        …
        
        They were now awake after a bad night’s sleep, with Norman and Jules taking turns operating the ship throughout the night.
        
        It was 7 in the morning according to the watch, but the sky tells them otherwise. It was even more dark and foggy than previously, probably because they were closer now. They looked out the window and they saw a light. A beacon… A shining blue ray was pointed up toward the sky. A light so bright that they can see from such a great distance. It seemed to be generating the clouds.
        
        Flying creatures were above the clouds, and Norman quickly shut off the light of the ship. 
        “So they won’t see us,” Norman says, before taking over the wooden steering. Bob realisesrealizes now, a question that he was asking earlier had been answered. So that’s how they got into the continent of North America despite the strong trench of deep water that surrounds it.
        
        In no time, they’re right in front of it. They were in front of the mess. They were standing on the ship alive right in front of the sources of all destruction. Seeing the creatures lurk out of the hole allows them to confirm everything. They know what the existence of this means. They have finally made it this far, they have barely survived the unsurvivable, but most importantly, they have made it this far alive.
        
        They survived the first wave of zombies from Underneath
        They found a safe place to prepare, The Hide
        They have survived and Breached
        They went Out The Gate
        They made it To America
        They made it past the CDC
        They Did Indeed Thrive
        They went to the door of danger and Knocked On The Door
        They have done it all…
        It is of course Underneath.
        It is underneath that caused this whole chaos…
        And the final Arc had begun.
        Chapter 10- Sneak in the Den
        
        They are on the ship.
        Heading toward where they should not be at the most.
        
        Only 10 minutes before they land, they get their gears together in preparation.
        
        “Hi,” Charlotte walks towards Luxury, who was packing her gear in her cabin room. Luxury tilted her head and realised her, and placed her belongings beside her. 
        
        “Come in.” She taps beside her on her bed, indicating Charlotte to have a seat.
        
        “We are gonna solve this mystery, we are gonna find a cure and save everyone,” Charlotte says affirmatively. Luxury nods, and realisesrealizes a string of metal hanging out of her pocket.
        
        “What’s that?” She questions Charlotte pointing at the hanging string of metal. Charlotte takes it out of her pocket, revealing a necklace with small heart-shaped stuff at the end. She opens the stuff, inside showing a family portrait. Charlotte rubs it with her finger and looks over at Luxury.
        
        “My family,” Charlotte said. Glimpses of determination caught back to Charlotte’s eyes.
        
        …
        
        The group moved silently through the dark and foggy night, their footsteps muffled by the damp ground. Steven, with a determined look in his eyes, glanced over at Norman, a seasoned adult who had seen his fair share of battles. The two exchanged a nod, a silent understanding passing between them.
        Ahead of them, Military Commander Taylor, or Chloe led the way, her every movement deliberate and cautious. She had been entrusted with the responsibility of guiding the team to this final location, where all the answers to their burning questions about the zombie apocalypse awaited them. The massive hole they had seen in the footage and the mysterious beam of light shooting skyward had drawn them closer, compelling them to uncover the truth behind it all. It won’t be long till they find the cure and end it all.
        Walking beside Chloe was Jules. Back in the library in New York, Jules had managed to secure some important intel about the strange occurrences and had managed to decipher some of the encrypted messages left behind by the enigmatic force behind the apocalypse. Her expertise in technology and hacking would be crucial in unravellingunraveling the secrets that lay ahead.
        The source, that glowing beacon. As they traversed the treacherous terrain, creatures flew past them, screeching in the distance. Zombies aimlessly wandered nearby, their shuffling steps oblivious to the presence of the stealthy group. It was a nerve-wracking environment, where one wrong move could spell disaster. They kept their stealth well, and maintained it through. They were halfway there, just a few more steps to go-
        FLUMP!
        In a sudden and tense moment, their carefully maintained stealth was nearly shattered when Jimmy, a member of their group, inadvertently disturbed the silence by stumbling over a fallen branch. The creatures' attention was immediately drawn, and panic gripped Jimmy as he froze, anticipating the worst. It was all eyes on Jimmy.
        Thoughts of impending doom raced through Jimmy's mind, repeating like a relentless mantra. I'm dead. I'm dead. I am really dead now. Helpless and unsure of what to do, he remained rooted to the spot as the zombies gradually closed in, their presence palpable even in the already darkened sky, visible from a considerable distance away.
        Reacting swiftly, Steven rushed forward, pulling Jimmy toward safety. Together, they found refuge in the cover of a nearby bush, collapsing in an exhausted heap alongside the rest of the team. Jimmy, still in shock, struggled to regain his composure, attempting to control his breathing, which seemed unbearably loud in the tense atmosphere. Close call for the team. Another nearly sacrificed.
        Xander, scanning their surroundings, assessed the situation and swiftly moved to Jimmy's side. Leaning in close, he spoke with a calm and soothing voice, trying to alleviate Jimmy's fears. "It's okay, Jimmy," Xander whispered gently. "We're still here. Nothing happened, and we're going to make it through this together." He looked at that black ball of hope again and smiled. He was filled with determination.
        Gradually, Jimmy's terror began to recede as the reassurance in Xander's words seeped into his consciousness. His breathing gradually quietened, and the group cautiously observed their surroundings, taking care not to expose themselves. To their surprise, the zombies seemsseemed disoriented, shuffling aimlessly with a sense of confusion. Even the more unusual creatures caught a glimpse of the ground and flew away, adding to the group's relief.
        A collective sense of comfort washed over them as they witnessed this unexpected display of empathy from Xander. Even Steven and Luxury, who had often witnessed Xander's tendency to assign blame, couldn't help but smile at this newfound side of their friend, realisingrealizing that their unity and trust would be their greatest strength in the face of the encroaching darkness.
        Luxury, known for her perceptive nature, recognized the shift in Xander's personality. It feels so sudden, yet it feels unexpectedly natural the way he acted. She smiled warmly, acknowledging his growth and ability to provide support in a moment of vulnerability. It was moments like these that strengthened their bond as a team, reminding them of the strength they drew from one another in the face of adversity. He changed; She thinks to herself.
        With renewed determination, the group continued their stealthy approach toward the suspicious location. The final fight awaited them, and with each step, they grew closer to unraveling the mysteries that had plagued their world, as they walked each step closer to the cure. Together, they would face the unknown and emerge victorious, armed with the strength of their unity and the hope that lay within their hearts.
        
        
        After an arduous hour of trekking through the clammy, foreboding forest, a ray of light pierced through the dense foliage. The beam, once faint and barely perceptible, now blazed with an intensity rivaling the sun, illuminating their weary faces. They had reached their destination—they stood before it, captivated by its presence.
        Time seemed to stand still as they basked in the profound significance of this moment. The light symbolized the culmination of their resilience and unwavering determination. It whispered promises of a future free from the encroaching darkness that threatened their survival.
        In the face of the radiant spectacle before them, their hearts swelled with a mixture of relief, anticipation, and a renewed sense of purpose. They knew that their challenges were not yet over, but they were fortified by the knowledge that they had come this far and were now on the threshold of a new chapter in their struggle for survival.
        Turning from the light, their eyes fixated on the abyssal void stretching endlessly below them, a chasm that descended into the depths of darkness. It was a sight that defied comprehension, a terrifying spectacle that hinted at the horrors lurking Underneath.
        As their gaze penetrated the infinite expanse, a stark realization dawned upon them. There was an eventual conclusion to this unfathomable descent, and they found themselves teetering on the precipice, far removed from the safety they sought.
        With a bone-chilling revelation, they witnessed the nightmarish truth manifesting before their very eyes. The undead, in all their grotesque forms, emerged from the gaping maw of the abyss. The zombies, driven by insatiable hunger, clawed their way out and even defied the laws of gravity, leaping and soaring to the sky from Underneath.
        They were fascinated in a horrible way by the unusual creatures causing infections from deep within the Earth and were determined to find answers. They believed that by exploring the unknown depths, they could discover a solution or cure for this mystery.
        They were confident that whenever a harmful infection emerged, a remedy was usually developed to prevent self-infection. They firmly believed that a cure existed within the depths they were about to explore.
        However, they had a lingering doubt—what if this affliction was not caused by humans? The possibility that unknown forces were responsible added another layer of uncertainty to their pursuit.
        Nevertheless, they held onto hope that by investigating the origins of the phenomenon and witnessing its beginning, they would gain valuable insights to solve the remaining puzzle. They believed that understanding and investigating the starting point would lead them to a solution. Their determination to save Andle and the world depended on this belief.
        That’s why they’re here. That’s why they’re here at a location that, by all accounts, should have been avoided at all costs. Yet, driven by their unwavering resolve and the burning desire to find answers, they had deliberately ventured into this treacherous realm.
        The risks were evident, and cautionary whispers urged them to turn back. However, their purpose was clear –to find a cure, solve the mystery, and save the world, in order to return everything to how it was before all this mess; peace,  joy, and not having to worry about survival.
        The air surrounding them thickened with fear and desperation as the relentless onslaught intensified. It became evident that their journey had taken them to the heart of darkness, where the line between life and death blurred, and the ravenous undead reclaimed the surface of the earth.
        
        “Look,” Chloe whispers, pointing to an elevator-looking thing just beside the hole. It was perfectly clean despite the rest of its broken destroyed environment. It looked like the remains of the buildings that used to be there.
        
        Something ain’t right. Norman was overly suspicious about the elevator, they were perfectly fine despite the disastrous. It can’t be a coincidence that the whole building collapsed and the elevator was perfectly fine. It was obviously a sign, a clue, but a clue to what? He scanned around the area. Going directly down will be too risky with all the zombies coming out of it. 
        
        Chloe was right, the elevator might lead us down there. Steven points to another elevator on the dark horizon, then another one, and another more. There is more than one elevator. After pointing them out, Norman understood what this means. It is specially built for these devil-like people to access underneath. Cause only a devil would release a horrible plague that turns everyone in the world to mindless half-dead beings, right?
        
        With unwavering determination, Norman reassured the group in a hushed tone, emphasizing the necessity of descending through the elevator as the optimal course of action.
        Resolute in their decision, they embarked on their perilous journey, risking their lives in a desperate sprint toward the nearest available elevator. The urgency of the situation hung in the air, magnifying the intensity of their movements.
        As they stepped inside, the elevator doors closed swiftly, enclosing them in a confined space that symbolized both salvation and trepidation. With a single press of the solitary button, the elevator initiated its descent, plunging them into the depths below.
        For Steven, every passing second felt like an eternity, the passage of time elongated by a cocktail of uncertainty and fear coursing through his veins. The relentless descent seemed to stretch on indefinitely, amplifying the psychological toll of the unknown that awaited them at their destination.
        
        As the metallic elevator doors slowly slid open, revealing the hidden contents within, a sense of anticipation filled the air. However, the sight that greeted them was far from their expectations, shattering any glimmer of hope or excitement that had lingered in their hearts.
        Bob, unable to conceal his shock and disappointment, uttered just two simple words, laden with a profound sense of despair and dread. His voice quivered, and his face twisted into an expression of sheer disbelief as he managed to whisper, "Oh no..." The words escaped his lips, carrying a weight that eclipsed any ounce of amazement or joy that might have been present at that moment.
        
        It was at that moment they knew, they were checkmated. There was a traitor among us…
        Chapter 11- The Traitor’s Gambit
        
        They were completely surrounded by creatures.
        
        Not by normal infecting zombies, but by what seems more supreme, intelligent, and original infectants.
        
        “Oh god,” Liam speaks after Bob and starts to spam the elevator button. Norman stops him, before unselecting the elevator. 
        
        “We got this.” He affirms everyone. Steven pushes Norman aside and steps out of the elevator. Norman pulls out what looks like an actual assault rifle off his backpack; he acquired this from the ship. The zombies slowly approached them in caution; but there was no hiding, an obvious planned attack, they were expecting them before they even arrived.
        
        They were expecting us to come.
        Someone leaked information about us coming to them.
        That was the one and only explanation.
        But that leads to another question.
        Who?
        Who was this traitor?
        
        Steven pulled out his sword swiftly and held it in front of him, with his arms gripping it and sweat dripped from a sense of uncertainty. The commander and Jules both got real actual guns from the ship like Norman. They pulled it out as judging by the looks of the creatures, even the best they can do with those nerf guns might do nothing to them.. Soon after, the first creature dashed directly toward them. More and more started sprinting after one another. The finger was on the trigger. Closer and closer. And the first bullet was fired.
        
        Steven sliced his sword through one another. He spun the sword like a fidget spinner as it pushed back any zombies around him. Luxury looked left to right, unsure of what to do with her lack of weaponry, then just realized about the plants that were in her small bag. She quickly pulls open the strap, revealing a flaming and fierce fire-peashooter, and a green, friendly-looking pea shooter.
        
        "Advance!" Norman's commanding voice echoed through the chaos, infusing the team with a renewed sense of purpose and unyielding determination. With meticulous coordination, they forged ahead through the treacherous battlefield, navigating every obstacle in their path with unwavering resolve. Noah, wielding his legendary lightsaber, showcased unparalleled skill as he deftly cleaved through the approaching enemies, leaving a trail of defeated foes in his wake. Meanwhile, Elijah's recently acquired metal slippers emerged as an unexpected yet potent weapon, delivering thunderous blows that sent the enemy creatures sprawling, their resistance shattered one by one. Their relentless advance led them to a staggering revelation—a colossal beaker, its towering presence reminiscent of the mighty T-rex. 
        
        As Steven slices, another zombie or two, he finds something interesting, something that may end up as an end to this mess. A beam would shoot up and disappear. Creatures were getting ejected off to the sky, before falling down and landing as perfectly as a cat. In an instant, Steven recognized the potential significance of this vessel; it is the thing that creates the creatures. 
        It is the spawn point of all madness.
        
        The battle quickly intensified as they got closer to the beaker. Jules got out a thin phone and started to tap on it, before placing it back into a pocket. 
        
        “It is what you guys think, it’s the spawn point of the creatures, it's the device that makes these horrific and infectable creatures,” Jules explains and confirms their theories. Elijah looked at the Neon Bright Vessel for a while, before throwing his metallic slipper at it. As if it was nothing, it bounced back and Elijah caught it with his other hand. Just reflexes.
        
        They know what to do, as Luxury positioned herself to be facing outwards, constantly watering the plants as they fought against the surrounding horde. Steven, along with Noah and Liam, each having a melee weapon, started to bang it at the vessel, before getting joined by Norman and Chloe, both firing their guns at the unbreakable. 
        
        Shoot. Steven thinks, as he tries to kick away a creature that was gripping tightly at his right leg. It is not letting go, no matter how he shakes it. His eyes focused on breaking the beaker, he tried to shake it once more with more power, but it was no use. The jaw of the dangerous being got closer and closer as every millisecond passed. Those teeth dripped with the juice for infection sharpen. Steven could even feel its breath and thirst. Until finally, it opened its mouth and bit his leg. Steven got bitten.
        
        Xander came running toward Steven and with his strength, he kicked the creature into bits like a human stepping on a bug.
        “You good?” He questions, before pulling a craft knife out of his pocket.
        “Yeah, thanks,” Steven replies. Steven looks over at the bitten scar. I have no time to think about it yet. Steven’s mind was on one thing and it wasn’t moving its focus onto anything else. Break this Vessel. Find a cure. You gotta find the cure.
        
        “Attack closer!” Charlotte commands all of them. They turned around and realized Charlotte, who was firing toward the vessel with a bow and arrow. Norman takes a step back and realizes what she meant; the vessel isn’t gonna break if they keep attacking this separately, they need to focus on a specific point together. If they can’t break it individually, they must beat it together. They need to push the limits together.
        
        “They’re getting through!” Luxury shouts from the side where most of the horde is crowding and advancing from. There are too many of them. So much that not even the pea shooters can handle it. Xander rushed towards Luxury and pulled out another knife from the bag with the pea-shooters.
        “You protect this side, I will go to that side!” Xander shouts and hurries over to the other side of the group, where the commander and Jules are. He gripped the two knives tightly with one in each hand, before starting to slice the creatures, aiming for the head.
        
        While the two, or four including the plants were trying to prevent them from getting close to the rest, they managed to collectively find a specific point to target on. Their collective strength and unwavering determination focused on shattering the immense container, after Bob managed to sneak in and draw a large red cross using some blood from the creatures. Steven realizes something. Wait, why do creatures have blood? But they were not human?  Like always, he placed his thoughts aside. With their combined strength, the large vessel broke and ended with a powerful explosion of glass and a bright green liquid spreading everywhere. Sadly, a few drops landed on Noah and Steven, making them react with disgust, more disgust to their school’s toilets and trust them it was hell being in one of those. Noah stepped back and said, "Eww," demonstrating his dislike of the green substance on his face. 
        
        “Look!” Jules shouted as the green vessel's removal revealed a humongous wooden door. A door that beholds the secrets, maybe even the leader of chaos.
        
        Judging by it being the only door forwards, they ran toward it, with Elijah running the fastest, in no time, he was at the front of the group.
        
        “Slow down!” Luxury shouted, who was trying not to run too bumpily so the plants could aim properly. The team surged forward toward the unknown with only one thing in mind; find the cure and save the world. It just repeats and repeats. They were soon in front of the intimidating entrance.  However, their path to reach it was obstructed by the horde of relentless creatures, threatening to hinder their progress. Steven and Noah both went to the back and started to push back against the tough creatures to keep their ground as if they were stalwart defenders. As the rest of the team worked together to figure out a way to open the obstinate door, Noah and Steven became important to the group’s progress, their weapons becoming a whirlwind of defense and resilience. Tho, the team must act fast, Noah and Steven won’t hold on forever.
        
        Through unyielding perseverance and unwavering teamwork, budging, hitting and kicking, they finally succeeded, unlocking the door and revealing a room that was just as the door indicates, massive in both size and magnificence. It was beautiful, and the group was surging with renewed determination, each step is a new step towards their beholden cure. With a renewed surge of adrenaline coursing through their veins, they raced through the expansive chamber, their footsteps resonating with purpose and urgency.
        
        Noah waited and held his stance until he made sure that all of them had gone in.  He looks around his surroundings, trying to find an opening to dash for the door. But to his unluckiness, the horde had gone to an incredible size. The door won’t hold them. They will break the door down and interfere with us as we try to search for the cure. They will distract and put us down when we fight against the final as we save humanity and everything within it. They may even corner us and eat us bit by bit. Those thoughts shimmered through his spine. Think Noah! Think! You’ve come up with ideas with rockets before! This should be an easy task compared to that. Think!
        
        He swings his lightsaber, slicing through two creatures at once, and starts to dash towards the door. Steven, who was inside, running, notices the emptiness that Noah filled. He turns back and realisesrealizes Noah is struggling with the gigantic horde. 
        
        “Noah!” Steven shouts. Using the new Atomsplit katana that he had brought out as his main weaponry, he cut through the creature that was holding him back into two pieces, before starting to sprint back. 
        “Steven!” Jimmy exclaims in confusion, as he turns and realisesrealizes Steven’s footsteps sound. He looks over and notices Noah too. Hearing all these noises, Bob noticed the situation and tried to run back. I gotta help them. A creature was next to Bob, and the creature slowly opened his mouth wide, revealing rotten and yellow teeth. Another was about to get infected. Luckily, Norman quickly jumped right next to him and kicked away the creature.
        
        “Focus, we gotta keep advancing, here,” Norman tells Bob, who was in shock after what happened beside him. Norman chucks the pistol into Bob’s hand. Bob looked over back to Norman, but he was already long gone with another pistol that he seemed to equip from his pocket. Another came directly toward Bob's head first, but this time he shot it away. Sorry you guys. Bob regains and reorganizes his thoughts, as he catches up to the main group and attacks the creatures. Norman feels sorry for them too, but he knows that it is necessary to save everyone. He knows that sacrifices are necessary with his decade of experience. 
        
        Almost! Noah was nearly there, nearly. But to his fortune, not just one, or two, or three, but many creatures along with some mixes of zombies, attacked and were crowding over him, like a horde of bulldog, feasting on a raw piece of beef.. He looks through the door and notices Steven coming back and Jimmy chasing him. We can’t defeat this horde. We just can’t. We’re deadlocked
        
        He knows what he must do. With his remaining strength, he made a final dash, kicking away all of the beings that were clinging to him and releasing his precious lightsaber that was covered in blood and who knows what. He was exactly where the door was and looked back. Yup, I might have to do that.
        
        He pushes the unlocked door shut, leaving him on the outside, away from the sight of everyone else. I have to stall them for as long as possible. They might get too far in that the creatures won’t be able to sense and try to breach the door. I trust them to find the cure and save everyone.  Sorry. He thinks in his head, as he lays down with his back against the door as he catches a glimpse of his lightsaber that’s too far to reach. There is no use. But you know what? Let’s do this.
        
        “If you guys want a piece of my group, you will have to get past ME!” He shouted at the zombies as he made his final attempt to push them back. He furiously kicked and punched each zombie that came close, and despite still being bitten all around, he had one thought in his mind, come on lads, find the cure, don’t make my sacrifice to be in vain. 
        
        That was the last thing Steven wanted, another friend to die, another friend to sacrifice. The word sacrifice echoed around his head again, nevertheless, he still came and started to bang against the closed door, hoping to open it, but the horde was crumbling all over it, just as the sounds indicate. He could hear Noah’s silent yet distressing breathing, and it’s the sound that brought him back to some painful memories..
        
        “Noah!” Steven repeatedly shouts, as he fiercely attempts to breach the door. Yet Noah, resolute in his conviction, replied with a resounding declaration.
        “Find the Cure!” He shouts, and Jimmy heard it loud and clear, he was beside Steven and held his hand.
        “Steven.” He speaks softly. Steven wasn’t sure what he was supposed to feel. It’s just, death is not a thing you can describe.
        “He is not dead! We will find the cure and save him, save Andle, save the world.” Jimmy speaks, Steven get’s it and his thoughts clear up a bit, but is still hesitant if running and finding the cure is the best choice. What if there wasn’t a cure?
        “We have to try. We can’t let his sacrifice go in vain. A sacrifice isn’t a sacrifice if nothing good comes out of it! It’ll be just suicide! Wake up!” Jimmy was now shouting while trying to read Steven’s mind by his expressions. A sacrifice isn’t a sacrifice if nothing good comes out of it. 
        
        Soon, his thoughts and hesitation were overtaken by a deep sense of understanding. He conveyed his gratitude with a heartfelt “Thanks” and propelled himself toward the awaiting companions, who were tenaciously battling the remaining creatures, their collective might diminishing the enemy's ranks. Noah’s final breath was heard before there was absolutely nothing but silence, and Steven sprinted along with Jimmy behind him. As Steven reunited with the rest of the team, Jimmy came running beside him.
        
        “Thanks, Steven. Let’s do this.” Jimmy speaks assertively and pulls his fist forward for a fist bump. Steven chuckles despite the numerous words, sadness mixed with angry thoughts circling around his brain, and fistbumps him back. Determination reignites.
        
        There was soon nothing left but blood and disgusting parts from the dead creatures. The team stood bright and tall, as three figures slowly approached them.
        
        “Get ready,” Norman spoke, and everyone gripped their weapons tightly, afraid but ready for what was to come.
        
        “Well well well, we’ve been expecting you fellas.” A creature appears in the middle of the three. But this is different, it has actual legs and looked like it would camouflage well under the water. It was riding on a giant, cool looking robot that seems to have tank tread wheels.
        
        “Wait, Boss Sea Creature!” Norman shouts in shock. Jules and Chloe, both took a step back. The commander’s face shivered in both fear and uncertainty. Steven looks at the three, and he knows that it is not good to judge by their looks.
        
        But if that was surprising, Xander was sure to find something worse, a friend, who turned out to be a foe.
        
        “Oliver!” Xander yells from Steven’s right. Everyone turned to look at the dark shadowy figure on the right as it slowly got closer. In a second, Steven can see Oliver from his angle. It is Oliver. Oliver walks out of the darkness with laughter on his face. “Didn’t expect you guys to make it this far ya’ll”. His glasses shattered and his shirt half torn. As he turned toward Jimmy and stared at him in anger and rage. What the… Steven’s thoughts were interrupted when another familiar face appeared from the sea creature boss’s left. 
        
        “The Math teacher!” Bob shouts in shock and confusion, Norman notices the two other figures; Oliver and the teenager’s math teacher as the group shouted them out. Everything they believed, their cherished theories and notions, crumbled before their very eyes, plunging them into an abyss of uncertainty and leaving them teetering on the edge of a bewildering void. Their most trusted turned out to be their most wanted.
        
        “Why do they get called by magnificent titles or names and I’m just the math teacher you doofus.” Mr Amad shouted from across the room as the three slowly approached them. Slowly in a face of rage and magic, Mr Amad pulled up metallic bits from the ground and it hovered over the air. 
        
        “Argh!” He shouts, and what seemed like by his control, a few metallic pieces that made the space flew toward the group. 
        
        “Look out!” Bob shouts and pushes Steven and Jimmy, who were in the range of the metal away. The pieces were directly in front of Bob, still flying in mid-air. Bob saw his life flash before him before he was crushed and sent flying away. 
        
        Is this what it meant? Is this what helping might bring consequences mean? It dosen’t matter, Bob. It dosen’t. You saved them. What’s important is that you’ve saved them. This means that the novel is talking the truth here. It is not an ordinary book, it is actually magic, just like the -
        
        Before he could finish thinking, agonizing pain surged through his body, engulfing him within its relentless grip in an instant. His vision blurred, becoming increasingly foggy with each passing millisecond. Darkness loomed ever closer, gradually enveloping his consciousness until, finally, he surrendered to the overwhelming pain. A moment flashed, a soul gone.
        
        Everyone saw the metal fly past them, but it was so fast that before they had time to turn, the whole situation turned into a heart-stopping moment in an instant. As a deafening explosion reverberated from behind them, shaking the very ground beneath their feet. 
        
        In an instant, Steven's world turned into a nightmarish tableau. Before he could fully comprehend the horror unfolding before his eyes, he witnessed the unthinkable—Bob, laying sprawled on the ground, his lifeless form motionless, a gargantuan metal shard gruesomely impaling his chest. The sight was incomprehensible, defying the boundaries of reality. Blood gushed forth from the gruesome wound, a macabre spectacle that seemed ripped straight from the pages of a horror film. But this wasn't a mere illusion, it was a chilling, horrifying reality that engulfed them all.
        As Steven's mind struggled to process the unimaginable tragedy, his attention was abruptly diverted by a glint of metal hurtling towards him with deadly intent. Time seemed to freeze as he stood there, momentarily paralyzed by shock. However, the urgency in Norman's voice shattered the spell of inaction, jolting Steven back to his senses. With his unexpectedly fast reflexes, he managed to sidestep the lethal projectile, narrowly evading its potentially fatal trajectory. The air crackled with tension and the acrid scent of danger, anger, and most importantly, confusion. 
        This is no joke. Death and blood are no joke. Saving the world is no joke. Betrayer is no joke.
        The three villains were now close enough for the group to see them properly. It is indeed them. It is indeed the boss sea creature from the underwater castle, the math teacher who was supposedly sick the last time they had math and Oliver. Their friend Oliver. It was like a hole, it sucked the trust out of them.
        
        What in the great beer of China is happening.
        
        Chapter 12- A Hole So Dark
        
        Why is the sea-creature boss not dead?
        Why is Mr. Amad, the math teacher, here amidst all this?
        Most importantly, why would Oliver, someone we hold dear, find himself entangled with such wicked souls?
        
        “Bob! Liam shouts and hurries away to where Bob is to examine his wounds. 
        “Oliver, why are you there?” Steven asks desperately. It can’t be, right? He isn’t a person like that, right? He had lunch with us, almost every morning tea and lunchtime. He plays with us, right? No. Wait. No. He doesn't play with us. Every time whenever we play manhunt or table tennis he just stares at his laptop, looking at something. Looking at something….
        
        Bang! The sound of a gunshot caught Steven off guard in his thinking. The echo of the bullet echoed over his brain, leaving a long, sharp noise all over him. He looked over to the left and noticed Xander’s mouth moving widely as if he was shouting something. Steven felt his brain going foggy, as he traced Xander around the massive room to Luxury. Traces of Blood got onto Xander. Luxury’s shoulder got a small hole that looked like a bullet hole.
        
        As Jimmy shook Steven awake, his eyes slowly unblurred the foggy vision and his senses were re-sharpened. Steven slowly rose back to his feet and surveyed the violent-filled surroundings. In this unreal moment, a profound realization washed over his mind, unveiling the true nature of this cruel and unforgiving world that left that irreplaceable emptiness.
        
        At the beginning of the apocalypse, there were 14 of them, fighting side by side all driven by the hope of discovering a cure and saving the world. However, their numbers dropped significantly throughout to only 10, each locked in a desperate struggle for survival against what was once dismissed as supernatural fiction; a merciless sea creature, an unexpected yet formidable opponent, and a sign of betrayer from someone beloved whom they’ve had never expected to do something as unforgiving as unleashing all hell and destruction upon the world?
        
        The weight of loss and despair floated and settled on his shoulder, an unyielding burden that threatened to consume him. Ethan and Noah turned into zombies, Bob, who was….. Dead. And Oliver, who was there, with the enemy.
        
        “How are you still alive?” Norman questions in dire rage.
        “Do you seriously think that I would go down that easily you filthy humans!” The boss said, before turning over and making them face its back.
        
        “HaHaHa.” It exclaimed, before slowly disappearing to the shadows. Norman ran as fast as he could, trying to catch up to the Boss, but he was quickly interrupted by Mr. Amad. 
        
        “You will have to get past me first!” The math teacher said and slowly floated up into the air. The teenagers were confusedly mad. How is the math teacher who only taught them Pythagoras and trigonometry floating in the air? Is it not human? It is not human. Humans can’t do that, even with advanced mathematics and science.
        
        “Yes, you people, do you think that I am just a random math teacher!” It said and pieces of slime from the zombie started to be flung toward him, turning him into a massive slime monster with eyes as plain as any ordinary human.
        
        The math teacher is no human. One question was still lingering around his head, what is Oliver doing there? Oliver wasn’t doing anything massive yet. Just walking slowly towards Jimmy with an angry expression. 
        
        “You will be fine Luxury, you will be fine.” Xander was still by Luxury, trying to calm her down and tying her wound after tearing off a section of his T-shirt with his teeth. Xander can tell that the wound was deep, it was lucky that her leather bag strap was there, which reduced the impact.
        
        The plants started to fire at the massive slime blob, maybe because it had detected that it was filled with zombie slime. Oliver was approaching Jimmy. Jimmy notices and asks him. How are you not dead? Were you kidnapped or something? Oliver! Oliver was sprinting now towards him, after placing his gun that shot luxury back into his pocket, with a knife out trying to get closer to Jimmy. Shing! Steven blocks Oliver's knife with his Atomsplit katana.
        
        “Don't stop me!” Oliver pulls out the small hand knife that was surprisingly small and takes a step back after getting deflected by Steven’s katana. 
        “It's all your fault, Jimmy. It’s all your fault!” Oliver shouts and dashed toward Jimmy again. Steven doesn't want to do this. He doesn't want his friends getting hurt again, he doesn’t want another death, another sacrifice. But seeing how Oliver had hurt Luxury and was going to hurt Jimmy next, with all his might, he cut through Oliver. Please, no more.
        
        Oliver didn't care despite the fact that the katana had sliced past Oliver’s leg.  Blood spurted out of the small cut wound but Oliver seemed unconcerned like he was over-determined to get his revenge. He pushed Steven aside. Steven, who was shocked by the inefficiency of the cut, got knocked off his balance by Oliver. Jimmy grabbed his craft knife tightly.
        
        “Why Oliver! Why!” Jimmy was now shouting off the top of his lungs, trying to understand and get a grip on the situation. Please, no more.
        
        As Xander sprinted alongside, an unsettling realization dawned upon him: Steven, in his innate nature, would not be the one to end Oliver's life. The burden of this grim task now fell upon Xander's shoulders alone. Fuelled by a mix of determination and desperation, he propelled himself forward, each passing millisecond urging him to run faster, to catch up to his fateful encounter.
        But fate, with a cruel twist of irony, dealt Xander a swift and unfortunate hand. In an instant, Oliver's hand darted into his pocket, retrieving a concealed gun. Without a trace of mercy, he aimed and fired, the bullet finding its tragic mark—Xander's head. The world spun into chaos as Xander's life abruptly and tragically came to an end, leaving a chilling void in the wake of this heart-wrenching act.
        
        “Xander!” Luxury shouts, as tears started rolling down her cheeks. The commander notices the kid’s injuries and wants to go help them, but is pulled back by Norman.
        
        “Let’s finish off this first,” Norman affirms to Chloe.
        
        She knows that he was right. They got their hands too full right now. This supernatural being was attacking full out, sending out everything with nothing but pure force. 
        
        “Yah!” Mr. Amad gave a loud roar, and this time, more than ten times the amount of projectiles were fired toward them. Norman moved backward, with his eyes fixed on the projectiles, he slides downward as one cut through just centimeters above him. With his strength on his legs, he spun them through the rocky tiles and eventually got to a halt. This isn’t working. This isn’t working at all.
        
        Oliver spins the firearm in the other direction, right at Jimmy. Jimmy’s eyes were directly looking at the gun, unsure of what to do, with a heavy sense of guilt and uncertainty as his beliefs crumbled into nothing.
        
        “Go to hell you fool! I shall finally get my well-deserved revenge. If it wasn’t for you. If it wasn’t for you, none of this would’ve happened.” Oliver ragingly monologues, as he clicks the gray and evil pistol.
        
        Xander falls to his knees, as uncertainty and regret slowly pile on top of his soul. Steven hovered over to Xander. Luxury was there with Steven, as Xander’s eyes were open for one last time, and a tear flowed down into the treacherous ground underneath him. Luxury sheds a final tear before she solemnly vows to herself. 
        
        “I will protect myself.” She silently whispers into her heart. The weight of the situation pressed on top of her; Ethan and Xander both died with half of a reason which is to protect me. She compels herself to her vow and thinks deeply- I will not allow a single soul to sacrifice for me, ever again. She sniffs back snot dripping out of her runny nose, before repositioning herself.
        
        With a resolute gesture, Luxury reached up and pulled down the obsidian necklace, a glimmering symbol of hope. Yet, her heart sank as the necklace failed to revive Xander, its magic unable to counteract the cold grip of death. Her gaze shifted, fixing upon the bite mark on his lifeless elbow, a stark realization dawning upon her. The truth was revealed in that haunting moment—the bite mark had robbed him of his humanity, rendering the necklace's power futile. It was the cruel mark of their desperate struggle against the encroaching darkness, a mark that had stolen Xander's very essence.
        She turns to Steven, who notices the bite mark on Xander’s elbow, as her mouth parted open.
        
        “You take this, I’ve taken too much from them.” She speaks assertively. Steven notices a sudden change, her voice is different. It wasn’t trembling with fear or uncertainty, it was assertive and cold, as cold as winter itself.
        
        Knowing that the obsidian didn’t work on Xander due to the bite mark, Steven grabbed the necklace from Luxury and put it on himself with a trembling hand. His right arm clenched around his sword, the grip growing increasingly tight, as a mix of anxiety and determination caused his palm to grow slightly red and sweaty. The urge to cry flooded up within him, threatening to break free, but he stifled it, knowing he couldn't allow himself that release until everything was resolved.
        
        "No!" Luxury's voice erupted, piercing the air as she pointed urgently to Steven's left. No longer content with passive shouts, she sprinted toward Oliver with unwavering determination. Steven looked over in fear as he cries for help one last time within his heart. Please, no more.
        
        Fearing the imminent consequences, he quickly propelled himself into motion as well. His heartbeat repeatedly punched the front of his bones, and his mouth drier than a rock. But their efforts were in vain, for it was too late. A deafening gunshot shattered the silence, reverberating through the air, and in that heart-wrenching instant, Steven's worst nightmare occurred before his very eyes.
        
        Why? Why must the world be so cruel? Steven's eyes blazed crimson, his teeth clenched tightly together, trembling with a mix of fury and desperation. WHY!
        
        His heart raced like a wild stallion, driven by a relentless surge of anger that propelled him forward. The obsidian necklace, a sinister extension of his rage, pulsed with ominous energy, fueling his every step, and amplifying his speed. The once-black obsidian gained a shining effect to it, as small winds of darkness shifted within it.
        
        Faster! Faster!!! His limbs moved in a frenzied symphony, his fury becoming a tempest that shattered his self-control. Each stride sent shockwaves through his body, unleashing the untamed power of his wrath.
        
        In a flash of lightning, Steven closed the distance, crashing into Oliver with a ferocity that defied reason. The obsidian blade sliced through the air, guided by his seething rage, as he pummeled his foe relentlessly, his cries of anguish intermingling with the haunting question.
        
        “Why Oliver! Why did you do that? Why! WHy! WHY!” He pulls out his blade, and the darkness of the obsidian polluted the sword like a river. The once shiny blade turned into imminent darkness that consumed everything surrounding it.
        
        “Oliver Lemons! You effing murderer!” He yelled a final time, Oliver Lemons- Jimmy thinks. Lemons? Jimmy’s head started spinning, but he manages to catch all of his thoughts and re-positions. Lemons! He held his stomach tightly, but despite his efforts, blood was still rapidly leaking out of it. He could feel it, the end. He could tell that this is it. But the thought of Oliver kept him from shutting his eyes. He stares at Oliver, who seems to be enjoying it, enjoying the constant beating from Steven. It’s like he was happy to die there, it’s like he had succeeded in his goal, in his mission, in his life.
        
        “Don’t, Steven,” Jimmy speaks ever so softly. Steven was unconcerned, they didn’t hear his quiet whisper. His blade lifted into the air right above Oliver. Oliver just lays there beneath him, smiling, like he was dying to die.
        
        “Don’t, Steven!” Jimmy repeats a little louder this time, which caught both of their attention. He pukes a few more blood to the ground, before getting assisted by Luxury. Luxury presses the wound along with Jimmy, but it wasn’t working at all, as Jimmy’s blood flow was increased and a large chunk of his inside covered in blood spilled out.
        
        “You finally remembered me, Jimmy…” Oliver’s face turned into a villainous smile, one that sent chills down all their spines. It was a smile unlike any they had ever seen before- a sinister, malevolent grin that seemed to embody both cruelty and sorrow simultaneously. It twisted Oliver’s features into a haunting mask, an unsettling sight that hinted at a darkness lurking within.
        
        As Oliver’s lips curled upward, the expression revealed a glimpse into a hidden side, one that they had never witnessed before. The smile spoke of a deep-rooted wickedness, a willingness to cross boundaries that others dared not approach. Yet, behind the veil of cruelty, there was a profound sense of despair that seemed to emanate from their very being.
        It was a smile that defied conventional understanding, an enigma that left everyone questioning Oliver’s true nature. How could one person harbor such conflicting emotions within a single expression? The duality of their smile painted a picture of a complex individual, someone burdened by darkness for redemption.
        
        The two looked eye to eye. Steven felt the cold intimidation and relationship between the two and loosens the grip on his katana. The darkness was released and it floated back into the obsidian, locking itself in it, causing the necklace to lose its shine and return to a pitch-black shade.
        
        12 years ago…
        
        “Sorry! I am terribly sorry. I shouldn’t have done that. I shouldn't have rushed.” The man in his 50s said. He was the truck driver that crashed and was currently being questioned by the police.
        “Mike Lemons, interesting name. And a 3-year-old son, Oliver.” The detective spoke calmly. 
        “Yes, that's me, I will pay for my crimes. But at least let me raise my son first! He will die without me, he has no money to survive and he’s only three!” He plead the detective, but the detective made a come-back with a disturbing statement.
        “Do you know that the person you killed had an 11-year-old nephew, named Norman? What about that since the guy you hit died, he had to forfeit from a rescue mission that killed an agent that has a 3-year-old son, named Jimmy, along with his mother? At least your kid still has a mum and you will be released soon, but what will you do about the small baby, called Jimmy!” He smacked the table hard, before leaving the room. The driver was left speechless and stopped pleading.
        
        “Sir, please put your hands behind your back, you are arrested for a possible case of murder.” The policeman beside him asked as he prepared the metal handcuffs. As Mike accepted his fate and allowed the policeman to arrest him, his wife stood stone cold as she could do nothing but look as the police brought her husband away. A door opened behind her and out came a toddler, who looked at his mother.
        
        “Where’s daddy?” The little boy asked. It was Oliver, who was only at the age of three. The mother didn’t reply to him, she locked the door and walked out the door in a blank expression. 
        
        The next time little Oliver saw his mother was a week later. The innocent boy lay on the floor, his frail body a mere skeleton. With an empty stomach, he gazed up as his mother threw some leftover pizza at him, her focus quickly shifting to opening a bottle of wine on the counter.
        
        Driven by hunger and desperation, Oliver hastily grabbed the unappetizing pizza and stuffed it into his mouth as if it were his last meal. It was a painful sight, the way he devoured the food, desperately seeking nourishment in a world that had forsaken him.
        
        Tragedy struck again as his mother's excessive alcohol consumption took her life. Left alone and abandoned, Oliver was sent to an orphanage, his only refuge amidst the uncertainties of his young life. Days turned into years, and he trudged through the corridors of his primary school, his left eye bearing scars and redness from the abuse inflicted by his mother.
        
        Bullies lurked around every corner, eager to torment him with taunts about his troubled family life. Their relentless cruelty knew no bounds, forcing Oliver to endure unimaginable pain and humiliation. In one particularly degrading act, they coerced him into drinking toilet water, leaving him feeling utterly violated and broken.
        
        While walking home one evening, he crossed paths with another gang of fearsome bullies. The bullies slowly approached him, and he was driven to a corner within seconds. Their shadows swallowed him, as all there was left for him was darkness.
        
        “Cash!” What looked like the leader demanded him. It was the eighth time this month alone. He placed his hands into his pockets and fiddled around, just to realize he had no more pocket money from the orphanage.
        
        “None? You know what this means. Boys!” The leader commands the group. They were equipped with baseball bats and metallic pipes. He turned to run, but after a few steps, he tripped and fell onto the floor. He turned to look at the bullies that were at least 5 years older than him, as they slowly approached him. They weren’t running at all, it’s like a cheetah chasing a small tortoise.
        
        To his surprise, all of a sudden a larger shadow covered all of them. The bullies look up with intimidated looks, before dropping their weapons and hurrying away. He turns behind to see the person that scared the bullies away. To his surprise, it was not an ordinary human being, it was a boss looking sea-creature. This formidable figure frightened even the cruelest tormentors. Offering him both protection and a morsel of food, the boss presented a chance for revenge, a flicker of resilience in Oliver's weary heart.
        
        With gratitude and a hunger that extended beyond the physical, Oliver accepted the offered sustenance. At that moment, the taste of the food held more than just nourishment. It symbolized a fleeting respite, a glimmer of strength amidst the overwhelming adversity he faced.
        
        …
        
        “Why do you think I joined you bunch of idiots? Why do you think I dropped my muffin when the zombies first showed up? Why do you think I hopped out of the plane? Who do you think advised the CDC that a plane is entering America? Who do you think advised the boss and got the creatures ready for your arrival here at the Underneath?” Oliver laughs with tears of joy and blood.
        
        Jimmy just lays there, as his eyes blinked calmly with severe regret. It’s all my fault. Oliver laughed once more before Luxury stabbed him with the knife in Xander’s pocket.
        
        “That does not excuse you for killing.” She spoke coldly, before turning his head around to face him again. 
        “Also, don’t call my friends idiots.” She finishes, before aiming the pea-shooters to shoot the few creatures that were advancing from the north. 
        
        Hurgh. Jimmy spits out an awful-looking amount of redness, which immediately shattered Steven’s thoughts about the complexity of the relationship Jimmy has with Norman and Oliver.
        
        “Jimmy!” Steven drops his sword beside Jimmy and saw the sinister crimsoned shirt as blood carried on to stain his once brand new shirt. The fact that it was new seemed rather insignificant in comparison to their situation. Jimmy grabbed Steven’s hand unexpectedly and smiled. Despite everything, he smiled, and it was the largest he had ever seen.
        
        “Thanks for everything. Thanks for being by my side this whole time. It really helped me a lo-” Without finishing the sentence, his eyes stop blinking, and a wave of silence washed through his head.
        
        The sudden silence from the death of his best friend caught Steven in the clutches of grief and anger. It consumed him like a relentless tide, fueling a deep-rooted resentment that took hold of his heart.
        
        It’s all your fault, you stupid sea creature boss, it’s all your freaking fault.
        
        Steven pulled the dead Jimmy’s eyelids shut. Rest in peace my best friend- he mutters in his heart.
        
        With a new sense of determination, he got up with his sword and started to run toward the darkness, where his task refines him to. His mind only spun one intention from that moment on, as it haunted every depth of his mind. His regret and anger surged within him, directed towards the sea creature boss as if it were the most despicable entity in the entire universe. Steven, in the midst of this realization, vowed; I will find you, and I will kill you.
        
        He turned back a moment to look at his other friends at the back, just to realize that the only kid left alive behind was Luxury, which went to Norman, Jules, and the commander, Chloe to assist them in defeating Mr Amad.
        
        Noticing Steven, she gave him thumbs up, urging him to move forwards. Her new cold determination flooded her presence as if she was a totally new person.
        
        He sprinted. His speed increased with every microsecond. Without him realizing it, he was running faster than he ever can, with the obsidian necklace glowing to his underlying demands. Two figures, a person with longer hair and one with shorter appeared in front of him. The longer hair figure noticed footsteps and turned her head to look behind.
        
        “Steven?” Charlotte questioned. Steven decelerated quickly and noticed Elijah and Charlotte, both running side by side as a larger shadow appeared in front of all of them.
        
        “How you so fast…” Elijah questioned the usually slow runner.
        “Your necklace.” Charlotte questions, as a foreboding sense of impending doom began to creep through his veins, like a chilling mist that whispered of dark secrets yet to be unveiled. 
        “Xander…” Elijah realizes a profound unease settled upon him, like a vise tightening around his heart. A chill coursed through his veins, prickling his skin, as if icy fingers traced an invisible path along his spine.
        “Sorry” was the one word that Steven spoke, before jetting down toward the larger being in front.
        
        Charlotte felt more depressed immediately, knowing that more of his friends have fallen into ruins. But one thing caught her attention alongside the disaster; the once dark and black obsidian glowing brightly. Elijah slams his precious slipper on the ground.
        
        “Damn it,.”Elijah shouts ragingly. He slowly lifted his eyes up, but in just another blink of an eye, Steven was gone, and a massive metallic wall separated the two from the way to the shadows.
        
        …
        
        Steven was face to face with the despicable being, his eyes glazing fiery. The once sparkle of innocence had dimmed, replaced by a steely resolve tinged with heartache.
        
        “I see that you have made it all the way through, I was told that you idiots are not to be defeated easily, but I never knew that you were that strong.” It monologues. Steven wasn’t listening, just staring fiercely into hate. Behind the boss was another cylinder, this one was however larger, as crazily big as his school. Thoughts scrambled over his head: That has to be it right? It has to; the thing that contains everything for zombie production.
        
        The evil villain continued his monologue, but without letting him finish, he sprinted fast, the necklace glowing brighter than it ever should 	have been. The villain quickly realized the run, as if he was already expecting it, he kicks Steven flying. Steven coughs and repositions himself, quickly realizing the fact that he can’t beat it; it was about ten times larger than him and have a monster-killing innovation. He maneuvers himself forward, directly toward the villain. 
        
        “Again? I see why you guys are idiots.” It speaks ever so darkly before the arm of the machine pushed forward toward Steven. With all his might, he stops the punch with his sword, the katana slowly darkened, as if the energy of the obsidian was unleashed into it. With a sudden panic, it quickly takes a step back. Steven pushes himself forward even more and slides beneath the machine, before leaping back up from behind. “Come on!” Steven re-confident himself. He pulls the blade high, it’s shine foreshadowed by the darkness of the obsidian. With a leap, he drags the blade down in full force, slicing off one of the legs. With a side gone, it struggled to maintain its balance, which eventually caused it to fall to its doom. A sound of “No!” was heard, before the large sound of destruction covered all audition.
        
        Gears and metal flew all over the place with the collapse of the machinery. Dust and grey covered the whole stadium, with bits and pieces falling into nothing but trash. 
        
        Steven’s mind recoiled, bewildered by his own actions. “How did I even do that?” he pondered, grappling with the enormity of his unleashed power. Yet, his introspective thoughts were abruptly cast aside as his gaze fell upon the colossal green cylinder, defiantly towering over the remnants of chaos and wreckage.
        
        The sight commanded his attention, commanding an air of ominous intrigue. Its massive presence seemed out of place, an enigmatic artifact amidst the debris. The towering structure emanated an eerie glow, casting haunting shadows that danced along the fractured surfaces surrounding it. It stood as a silent witness to untold mysteries, secrets lurking within its depths.
        
        Steven stared at it for only a second, before sprinting towards it. Unsure of what to do with the evil structure, he decides to destroy it. As he was just steps away from it, he jumps, hoping to get a better sight of the structure, but with the height of the cylinder, there seems to be no difference, just green and bubbling liquid circling around it, along with random body parts, such as an arm and some toes. I did it before, I can do it now, Steven gathers his thoughts. He shuts his eyes, hoping for success. I can do it.
        
        The blade was held up high once again, before getting slashed own to its imperial doom. The crack spread across the beaker like a virus, before the whole thing eventually collapsed. Traces of transparency cut through Steven’s skin, leaving marks of redness and cuts. But he was unconcerned; I did it, I finally did it. Or so he thinks……
        
        “No!!!” a door flew open, revealing the sea creature boss. Steven looks at the undead figure, half confused. He regrips his katana, leaking down traces of blood, fragments, and green liquids.
        
        “You killed my clone.” It laughs sarcastically. Steven looks at the unharmed figure with thoughts of awe and uncertainty; No way.
        
        “Do you know how long it took me to perfect my clone and the spawner?” It questions. Steven looks at it in disbelief and anger. If I can kill it once, I will kill it twice. He dashes toward it again. The katana is high up and slashing it down once again. But this time, it was different. A group of elite-looking creatures took the damage instead. Noticing the inefficiency, he jumps over it, hoping to land a shot from behind. But to his unluckiness, it was once again blocked by the creatures. They’re like bodyguards, protecting their clients no matter the cost.
        
        He lands multiple slices like a raging man. But all just as his first shot, no matter how hard he tries, it is no use. As he took down one creature to another, more and more just came to his aid as if there were infinite amounts of them.
        
        “A week! A single week!” The villain laughs again. It makes some hand gestures, and two zombies, a male and a female, showed up behind the shadows.
        
        “Mom? Dad?” Steven loosens his grip. Without mercy, the zombies charged toward Steven. Before they could reach him, they were blasted to death by the boss.
        
        “Haha yes. Now it’s you who killed them, you idiot.” It speaks so highly like the high magistrate. Steven’s heart was aching, engulfed in a deep sense of loss. First, he mourned the absence of his friends, snatched away all because of the manipulation and mischievous plans of the evil sea creature boss. And now, the cruel twist of fate had robbed him of his loving parents too. Grief’s heavy burden crushed his spirit, leaving him shattered and alone.
        
        …
        
        I gotta warn them. I gotta tell them.
        
        Liam was sprinting across the room, his neck dripping with sweat and his aroma saltier than ever.
        
        “Where’s the rest of them?” He questioned Luxury. Without saying anything, she pointed forwardforwards, and so he ran on, carrying the thought of Bob’s last words as they circled around his head.
        
        …
        
        “The, the quick brown fox leaps over three generations of hyperthermia trauma into a black dark hole.” Bob finishes. Bob wishes to help them succeed, he wants them to succeed and survive. He doesn’t want his, or his other friends or anyone in general’s sacrifice to go in vain because of nothing. The thought of that single line from the magic book, just can’t seem to be irrelevant, as everything else has been relevant. A thought suddenly surged from the back of his mind; It has to be a black hole, right?
        “Black hole…” Bob manages to spurt out before his heartbeat goeswent silent. I’ve lived, I’ve thrived, and most importantly, I’ve contributed.
        
        Liam knew immediately what this meantmeans; he had to get the message to everyone. He has to warn everyone about the possible existence of a black hole that might crumble or save the whole situation.
        
        “Elijah! Charlotte!” Liam shouts. Elijah was trying to break the wall down with his strong metallic slipper, while Charlotte was deep in thought, trying to figure out a solution.
        
        “We have to get Steven, he is inside fighting the boss,” Charlotte explains to Liam. 
        “Black hole!” Liam shouts. Elijah stops for a second and turns around to look at Liam in confusion. Charlotte takes a step forward toward Liam.
        
        “Black what hole?” She asks.
        
        …
        
        A black hole.
        
        Steven’s world crumbled around him, drowning him in an ocean of sorrow. Waves of despair crashed over him, as he clung to cherished memories slipping through his fingers like sand. Tears blurred his vision, mirroring the shattered fragments of his heart.
        
        “NOOO!!!” He screamed at the top of his lungs. Nothing seems to matter anymore. His emotions were too heavy for even the strongest man alive to bear. It seems too horrible to be a reality, but it is reality. This is the true cruelty of reality.
        
        The obsidian swirled up from the unbearable emotions, its light reflecting and deflecting over and over again, until eventually releasing a hole so dark. It seemed supernatural, a black hole releasing out from a small obsidian necklace, but everything that happened to him, from a zombie outbreak to the loss of loved ones, seemed supernatural but wasis real.
        
        Realizing the black hole pulling him in, he tries to fight back, with his insignificant-looking legs paddling upwards and his arms trying to get a grip of nothing but air.
        
        “Yes! Run away, you coward!” The boss made a last laugh, before signallingsignaling the creatures and walking away, back to the door. 
        
        He struggles and attempts to break free. But before he knew it, there was nothing but total darkness. You would expect a black hole to have some light of stars and supersonic brightness, but it was just as the name suggests. It was just pure black and emptiness, which seemedseems to mimic his loneliness. 
        
        “I’m a coward,” Steven yelps helplessly.
        
        “I’m a weak, idiotic, coward.”
        
        Epilogue
        
        It felt empty.
        
        There was nothing left, just a black screen of emptiness.
        
        Steven waves his arm around the empty space, trying to at least get a grip of something. But there was nothing, just shadeless darkness that seemed to go on infinitely.
        
        He felt no weight at all, as if he was just floating.
        The endless darkness led Steven into thinking various things. From the precious memories that he once held to the thoughts of life and death. He looks up, even though it’s the exact same peaceful, isolative, lonely view. Maybe he looked down instead of up, or maybe he looked to the right, but there were no surfaces or differences for him to tell.
        
        It wasn’t until a while later that he saw a light. The small glimpse of light slowly enlarged as he got closer. He started to paddle toward the light, but soon realized that there was no need for it. It’s like he was getting slowly sucked toward it. 
        
        Is this the end?
        
        The light blinded him, it was the brightest thing he ever saw in his life. Then his feet touched the ground, and sand got into part of his eyes. Sound of waves and people talking was now heard mimidly, until he fell onto his knees. His legs crumbled and jelly, it’s like he hasn't walked in years.
        
        He gripped tightly onto his sword, which was unsheathed tied to the strap that he was wearing. His necklace jiggled a bit, and his skin felt the coldness of the darkness that seemed to be surrounding him. He tries to get up with one thing in mind.
        
        “I got to. I got to help them.” He manages to mutter out. Until his mind was forced shut, and the small traces of light and sand turned into complete darkness.
        
        …
        
        Steven opened his eyes to find that it was no longer filled with sand.
        
        He pulls himself up a comfy bed. The light of the room shined brightly, revealing the whole aspect of it. The room was small, a bit too small to his liking. A small wooden chair was placed next to the bed that he was laying on that seemed very much out of place.
        
        22/10- 11:15 was the date and time that he read on his scratched watch.
        
        It’s only been 5 minutes, I can still rush and help them…
        The wooden door slid open, revealing a small young girl that looked about 8.
        
        “He’s awake! He’s awake!” She shouted excitedly. Another figure behind her told her to back away a bit, before revealing herself.
        
        “How are you?” She said calmly, her warm presence slowly turning the room into rather, comfortable and bright. She had a usual black hair, brown eyes, and looked about the same age as Steven himself.
        
        Getting a grip on the sword he held dear beside the bed, he pulled out the blade and stood on the bed, pointing it at her.
        
        “Don’t come any closer,” Steven said, his voice trembling. He pulled the curtains aside, revealing an unfamiliar location. Neon lights flickered, casting an otherworldly glow over the dense underground city that stretched out before them -a metropolis with metallic structures towering above, devoid of any visible trace of the sky.
        
        “It’s okay,” she said softly, defying his warning as she cautiously approached him.
        
        “I said don’t come any closer,” he repeated, his voice filled with a mix of fear and curiosity. She halted, her warm brown eyes meeting his cold stare.
        
        “Where am I?” Steven questioned, his confusion growing as he notices the futuristic cyberpunk city.
        
        “You are in the underground city of China. We found you lying unconscious on the sand while attempting to fish in secret. We can’t just leave you out there, so he brought you home with us,” she explained.
        
        “Underground city of what?” Steven inquired, his mind struggling to grasp the reality unfolding before him.
        
        “China. While the American government tries to keep its citizens calm and in control of the situation, China swiftly constructed an underground city for its population to survive,” she revealed.
        
        “Why underground?” Steven’s curiosity intensified, his senses sharpening.
        
        “Put the sword down first,” she insisted, and Steven complied, lowering his weapon before gracefully sheathing it.
        
        “Hide where your opponent least expects you,” she continued, her voice steady.
        “Which is underground, where the enemy’s main base is.”
        
        “Okay, can you take me to U.A.E, where the ‘enemy’ is? I need to assist and save my friends; they should be fighting there,” Steven urgently requested.
        
        “Chill, you’ve just awakened. Besides, you were unconscious for days,” she replied, trying to temper with his impatience. Steven checked his watch, his confusion deepening.
        
        “It’s only been five minutes since I was fighting with them, what are you talking about?” he asserted, a sense of unease settling within him. “Wait, what date is today?” he asked anxiously.
        
        “October 22, 2028. Why?” she responded, her eyes narrowing with curiosity and uncertainty.
        
        As Steven gazed into the distance of the neon city streets, his heart sank with the weight of realization. It couldn't be… could it? 
        
        It’s been five years?

        Part 2
        Prologue
        
        Hope was the will to live…
        
        The forest shambles, and the quiet lake wimbles. Hope flew away as the raindrops dropped. No more saving, no more compensating, just surviving. Surviving for what reason? They saw the deaths of their loved ones, been stood down by death and are now trapped in, nowhere, that they don’t know. All they know is to survive and not die, despite the inevitable.
        
        A lengthy five years swept by their feet, with humanity on the brink of extinction. Everything has changed. Earth on the surface was nothing more than a green wasteland. Anytime, any second now, the zombies could just push them off the edge if it wasn’t for Jules’s device. Only a small 800 people are left surviving on the surface, dealing with the same but increased struggles, bearly living, the rest either dead, zombified, or the 0.1% of people, approx 8 million people, living on the same level as the source of this horrifying apocalypse, UNDERNEATH. But this, they don’t know.
        
        As the hands of a piano man land sadly yet as lightly on the blackness and whiteness, the piano sounds alight, a piece of hideous music playing from the sadness of all souls, every note empty, with an ugly side dish of remorse. The bass of it deepens extraordinarily, the sounds husses around the room as everyone’s thoughts quieten. Then, the bang of the hands as they struck the keys of the piano with fear and might, as the chorus cried aloud. Everything was not heard, not a single soul, but the deepness of the piano with a villainess modification of now playing the Dark Cannon.
        
        As they surrounded Elijah, who was sitting at the black piano stool playing on the black grand piano, the light beyond them seemed to be dark. They were surrounded by what seemed like absolutely nothing, the song was all thy focused on. Their faces were books, however, all were telling the same story. Different prologues, different chapters, different epilogues.
        
        Same plots
        
        Their minds in grief, the worst thing that could happen happened, and there was no going back. Even if everything snapped back to what it was, their losses were too much to change. No going back to that studying, no going back to that excitement of a school trip, no going back to the horrifying experience of a new class, no going back to the impatience of break times, no going back to the tree. The legendary tree that once stood tall near the centre of all classes, the tree that held their precious memories of joy they had with one another, the tree that brought them a sense of belonging, with all friendships whether big or small, that mattered. Now it’s just slowly rotting, leaves turning cold brown and drifting away as zombies surround the soulless grinches.
        
        The deepest key was all there is for the finale, before the room went silent, as the final note echoed around the room. A tear flowed down Luxury, but without any hesitation, she swiped it away. She was once a quivering mouse, hiding in a tiger costume, but has now grown to be a real one. Her face filled with both determination and loss. Liam stood stiffly, his height seemingly increased by it, his arm joined together in front of him.
        
        “I remember Bob,” Elijah starts, breaking the silence like a hammer to the glass. The word “Bob” echoed as it boomed into their memories, enlightening those broken memories.
        
        “He used to play the piano to a rather insane level, grade 8, damn” He finishes his statement, before slowly getting up of the stool.
        
        After a short moment of silence, Norman got up from his wrecked wooden chair with countless thoughts in his mind. They all could tell that, after being together for so long.
        
        “How long do we have?” He questions Jules, his voice more mature and withered than his 5 years younger self.
        
        “A couple of weeks.” She replies, her hair now short, her skin no longer filled with makeup, her expression steady. Norman walks forward to stand before them, his mind repeating a speech he rehearsed and was gonna say for a long time, that he never got to say. But now, his heart kept beating.
        
        Do it, the time is right.
        
        Chloe Taylor, the once-renowned youngest Commander in Andle, grabbed Norman’s hand before he could walk away, her expression giving out a sense of uncertainty and worry. As a commander, she was supposed to be a symbol of confidence, yet she gave it an exception, that hid a much bigger secret. They had plans of marriage before the apocalypse, but this one single event faded and crushed their hopes of a rich, yet average life. They stared at each other for less than a second, before Chole released her hand, her fingers fidgeting. He pulls out a feeling of strong determination, as his jaws slowly widenwidened. “Do it”
        
        “I think it’s time.” He starts, before quickly getting interrupted by Charlotte.
        
        “No!” She shouts affirmatively, her foot down.
        
        “We are getting stronger as we practised every day for the last 4 years. I am getting more and more familiar with the power of the obsidian. We had held down this fort for 4 long years, and we shall continue to do so.” She finishes, her voice trying to persuade the rest.
        
        “What’s the point of staying here?” Norman sighs. As frustrated as he is, he kept a calm face, trying not to provoke anyone. Charlotte refrains from talking, the vague yet true statement from Norman hovered in her brain.
        
        “So what if held out for 1 more year? Or even 2 more years? What will happen then? What’s the point of staying alive in a single location for many more years to come, just to die eventually?” Norman finishes his statement, he has nothing more to say. He knew they will eventually have to leave this place behind and reenter the battle. It was better now than later. It’s just all not just common sense, but living a life without an objective is just as good as being dead. He was willing to take risks, risks that may even lead to death, if there is a small chance, just a small glimpse of light, that something positive might come out of it. That ball of hope wasn’t going to brighten if nothing happens.
        
        “I side with Norman.” Liam sighs, for once Charlotte seems to be wrong.
        
        “Me too. If it’s chances that we can salvage even a little of the life back then, I am willing to take that risk.” Luxury speeches, her voice filled with harshness and coldness, her innocence no longer within, her fate unredeemable. Elijah stood before everyone, his figure unusually bigger than before, his usual comedic sentences vanished without everyone noticing. His comical expression was replaced by a determined one as he whisperedwhispers,
        
        “It’s time to turn the tide.”
        
        Chapter 13- A Kid by the Name of Steey
        
        “You are free to go now, sir”
        The seven words of heaven.
        After so long, he can finally go back to his family.
        
        The jail gates opened, and a middle-aged man walked out. The cold winds blew past him, one he had never felt for the past 8 years. He zips up his thick jacket and pulls his hands to the pockets. He trudged towards a nearby bus stop and sat down on the icy bench, his weakened body shivering, but inside was a warm glow of reassurance.
        
        Moments later, and a light cut through the fog, a bus appeared from afar. The first vehicle he had ever seen in these cold lands, he waved trying to get its attention. To his luck, the driver noticed and pulled aside. The driver’s face was in uncertainty, he noticed. A scared, uncertain bearded man, constantly trying to avoid eye contact. After placing some coins in the can, he walked inside and settled in one of the empty seats. Well, all the seats are empty except for the driver’s seat.
        
        He looked outside as the background slowly transitioned from a winter helland to a nice cold spring with the undeveloped yet calming town, his destination.
        
        The bus eventually pulled to a stop as they approached the last stop. He hopped out of the bus, a sensational relief as he looked at the gate with a text in the mailbox; The Neilanamai’s sweet home.
        
        As he peeked through the gates, he saw a boy, 14 years old, fit and shooting hoops. Then, his bluish-pink basketball rolled near the gate and as he came over to pick it up, they glanced at each other, his eyes glowed like he was looking at the golden gates of heaven open up.
        
        “Father?” Steey questioned. His height increased from when he last saw his kid. Steey’s mind hushed, as he dropped the basketball he had in his hand. Like the happiest guy on earth, he rushed to his father whom he missed deeply. The last time he had seen him was when he was only 6, in 2014. The father cried in happiness, he was finally out of hell, back to where he deserves to be; by his precious child that deserves a father to grow up with.
        
        They both couldn’t stop squeezing each other, he was glad that his inaction of justice and kissing up to the rich did him good. Hearing all the commotion, the mother stared at them in disbelief, before tearing up and joining them. After years of suffering and separation, that’s too many to count for the family, the family was finally reunited from all that injustice.
        
        He was accused of something that he did not even do. The mother knows that he is innocent, but they did not appeal or fight back the court for the safety of their son. The rich used him as their scapegoat and threatened their child. If they fought back, their son’s head would be off by the next morning. His family was his first priority, and 8 years gone, was worth the sacrifice. He is now back with them, reunited, ready to watch as his son grows.
        
        “You’re still short I see.” He looks at Steey, and Steey nods, his innocence regrew from the discomfort of being bullied. Back at his school, he was often teased about his dad being a convict and him being “Short”. One time, he was trolled by the teacher for seating at the back as he “can’t” see the screen with his height, even though he very well can, with a few creative strategies. The world really is a bully, but Steey was very well a very bright boy, enough to cope with this cruel world. 
        
        “You must be starving, Let’s go inside and get you well-fed,” the mother said.
        
        They gathered around the table, the mother took out a few cups and gently placed some warm water. The bells rang as the wind blew. Birds sang lively songs, a fitting atmosphere as the family rested, sipping on steaming cups of tea, and engaged in many conversations. Having endured numerous hardships, Steey felt a newfound sense of vitality. Despite not wanting to disrupt the pleasant atmosphere, he realized it was the right moment to share his thoughts, especially now that his father was present.
        This was going to be hard.
        
        “Umm, mom, dad, … the kids and teachers are always making fun of me about my height and…” His parents immediately spat out their tea and shot a concerned look at Steey
        “You’re getting bullied!” The father shouts out after hearing what Steey had in mind. His mind was in pain of thinking his son getting teased and mistreated while he was away. His sense of guilt slowly deepened before Steey said something that made him cry on the inside.
        
        It was like everything was against his son, the rich threatening to log his head, and now a bully target?
        
        “It’s fine, I can handle it. I know that you are innocent and what you used to tell me, physically doesn't matter as much as emotionally.” Steey tried to comfort his parents, but his pain pushed him aside. He can accept getting bullied if it means his family could get reunited once again. However, his parents were having none of it, Steey’s mother reached for her phone, casting a soft glow on her face amidst the warmth of the campfire. The crackling flames provided a comforting ambience, enveloping them in a cocoon of cosiness amidst the chilly surroundings.
        
        “You are changing schools,” she said.
        
        …
        
        It was unusually warm for a Monday morning.
        
        He took off his gloves that we wore all year round as he hiked up that small white hill. On top was a building, smaller than the one he used to see. He takes a look at his frozen watch which wasn’t moving a single milimeter. Aargh. He taps it multiple times until eventually it revealed a time that he was not expecting- 9.00 am
        
        30 minutes late already.
        
        He was so late. He was late for his first day, at a new school, with students, and teachers, that he didn't know. Oh my.
        
        This wasn’t a great first impression.
        
        
        He started jogging, until eventually sprinting at full speed. His oversized shoes slowly come loose but he continues. Faster and faster, his speed increased to significant speeds. His mind unwrapping a nightmare that he doesn't wish to experience in his life. Until eventually. Until eventually.
        
        He bumped into someone.
        
        And she fell flat on her face.
        
        
        He doesn't have time for this. Flows of blood came true in front of him. He stood up, scanning all over his body to check his physical, only to find out that it wasn’t his blood.
        
        It wasn’t his blood.
        
        Scared and panicked, he looks underneath him. There stood a helpless girl covered in blood, her face indicating her age similar to his. The redness of her hair seemed to blend in with the blood on her hands. Great, something more to add to his bad impression list. He looked forward, a guy wearing black was among us. No, a group of guys in black, with wooden planks and metallic bats was among us. They approached the two 15s. He could run, he could hide, or he could PROTECT.
        
        He had no idea what was going on, but those guys in black looked like trouble, he stared at the barely conscious girl for a second, before eventually pulling her up. His gut was telling him to run, and take her with him as well, but his morale betrays his mind. He took a glance at her legs, her weak, shivering legs; She could still run.
        
        “Run!” Steey shouted, as he put on his gloves and took his stance in the unseemingly narrow corridor. Too late now.
        
        The girl stood up, her arms soggy, legs shaky, eyes twitching. Eventually, she did run after a bit of hesitation, her eyes staring at Steey with uncertainty as she sprinted. And that is it, Steey, all alone with the group of guys now visible. He clenched his fist, and started running towards one of them. “Ahhh!” was the thing he shouted out as he ran. Like a tiger killing a fish, the guy grabbed his head, stopping him from manoeuvring forward. They were the largest hands that ever existed on this earth. Steey fiddled around his pocket, trying to grab something from his pocket.
        
        “Trying to be a hero?” The guy spoke sarcastically. Unfortunately, his best weapon at hand was– A pencil. 
        
        Steey propelled the pencil, aiming directly at his eyes. Using all the might in his arm, he shot the pencil and released the tip of his fingers. The tip spiked through the air as if it’s made for it. To his surprise, it hit directly at the guy’s eye, making him yelp a horrifyingly piercing scream. Steey realised the situation- there was no way he could survive. He pushed the guy away, his eyes turning red from the whiteness of an eyeball. He darted off, running for his life. A few guys ran toward him, trying to catch him. Steey’s speed was unmatched to the devils, he moved his small legs as rapidly as he could, his muscles soaring up to the limits trying to get a lead. Some of the fatter guys caught up to him, they jumped toward the little steey one by one. Fortunately, his quick agility and small size allowed him to dodge the jumps from the guys. Tired, Steey slowed down and saw the school on the right. This is it.
        
        Suddenly, a van pulled up in front of him, stopping him by his track. He spun and ran the other way, but another group of guys showed up with bats that seemed to be soaked with blood. Wide-eyed, he looked at the bat and thought this could end in a bloodbath.
        
        “You’re dead now kid.” What seemed like the Boss’s assistant walked forward, his eye widening, his shadow forecasting Steey’s tiny body, before eventually turning away to go back into the van.
        
        “Finish him boys.” He spoke, as the door slid shut. He's done it. Now he's done it. Soon, he’ll be in Avernus.
        
        Fists, bats, sticks, feet, and muscles rained down on him. It felt like he was in a slaughterhouse. He crumpled to the ground as he got broken. His feeling of helplessness made him cry out the Acheron river of his inside until eventually, he lay motionless. His existence felt painfully insignificant, and he yearned for an end to it all. 
        
        “Let’s go now.” A voice said, as they left him all alone. Steey was unsure if he should've done that, saving the girl. He began to question the worth of his actions, realizing the path he took may hold little value, if any at all. Maybe instead of fighting, I should’ve run away with her? No, I stored enough time for her to escape.
        
        His eyes opened for a second, revealing a red contrast, as the girl appeared in front of him with some people behind her. Before he closed them tight, his regret hidden in him released for the time being as he fell into an abyss of darkness, the long trench and the painful effects of grief.
        
        It all felt like a hallucination.
        
        The next thing he knew was lying in a hospital bed.
        
        “You will be fine, boy.” The mother told Steey, trying to hide her desperate and worried feelings.
        
        “You did the right thing Steey, I am proud of you.” Retsamowt, his father said, releasing pride but tears of sadness from what he had seen happen to his boy. Steey tries to get up, his hands feeling broken, his whole body bandaged up. A doctor pulled the curtains of the room, before walking to Steey’s parents to discuss finances. Steey felt uneasy, the cost of treatment was way above their own limits and the look on his parents' faces made it pretty clear. It’s just way too expensive. Amidst the overwhelming sense of unease and doubt, a newfound determination rushed through him like a tidal wave within him. With a surge of effort, he managed to raise himself into a seated position. 
        
        “It’s fine, I can just recover at home,” Steey spoke, the doctor was surprised about that talk, even more surprised that he could still manage to get up despite the situation and state that he was currently in.
        
        “Bu..” Steey’s father thought of talking back to reassure Steey. But after looking at his face of determination, he knows that he knew about their current state in terms of money and they had no other choices.
        
        “We can take care of him at home. Can you walk Steey?” Retsamowt said, before walking near Steey to help him get up. The mother sighed, before she turned to the doctor and muttered something into his ear. Steey could hear the doctor sighing in uncertainty, but he gestured for the mother to the reception to pay for the cost of the bandages.
        
        He could barely get up, his leg was more broken than a glass door. A thought rushed to his mind; how did I get here? From his experience, he was being chased by men, and driven into Kyouki, he was beaten up and felt like he was in Kenos and fell into oblivion. Now he was wide and open in a comfy bed with the codependence of his parents. He was about to question his father until that girl that he tried to save appeared, her face slightly bandaged, but the rest of her seemed completely fine apart from a few scratches. She walked toward Steey and opened her mouth that’s slightly red from some blood marks.
        
        “Umm. Thanks.” She said in an embarrassed tone. Her voice kinda surprised Steey, it was the first time she had spoken to him. But what would you expect if she didn’t have an embarrassed tone in her voice? Steey literally jumped out to help someone he doesn't even know just to get injured like that. The gratitude sparked a light in Steey’s heart, his usual misfortune seemed to just float off his back, just like that.
        
        “Let’s get you home first.” The father said.
        
        …
        
        The girl followed them. As they sat in the car, she introduced herself. Name’s Rose, an orphan from a nearby orphanage that doesn't seem to care as much about the orphans. For safety, the mother decided to let her stay for a few days, just in case the bad guys showed up in front of her orphanage again.
        
        Orphan. Steey thought. His mind fell into thinking space; by the names of Zodiac, what fate would be worse than not having both of your parents and further more, getting chased by a gang of thugs? His tragedy of having his own father wrongly accused and being bullied seemed to hold little value in this situation. His mind thinking; I can’t believe there would be someone having a worse fortune than myself. The car eventually pulled to a stop in front of his house. With the help of Rose and his father, he managed to reach his bed without much pain. Rose sat by a stool beside the bed, as she helped him adjust his pillow height.
        
        “It’s fine, you don’t have to,” Steey speaks softly, trying not to accidentally choke out blood which would possibly scare the crap out of her. 
        “You saved me. You literally saved me, a stranger’s, life. What little can I do?” She spoke, her voice getting familiar with him. Steey’s mother soon appeared with 2 cups of tea. “Enjoy our traditional tea,” she said before she walked out of the bedroom to the living hall where Steey’s father was on his computer.
        
        “You know who my father is, right?” He questioned.
        “Yeah, I saw him in the paper.” She spoke casually, a bit too casual for Steey if she knew his father being an ex-convict.
        “I think he’s a fine person if you were his son.” She said, 
        “Aren’t you gonna try out the tea? It’s surprisingly tasty.” Steey spoke in his usual tone, his guard loose.
        “Can I? I love tea! The glass also looks very cool.” She takes a sip and lets out a sound of yum.
        “What do you hate then?” Steey questions her, himself surprisingly curious about her broad range of enjoyments.
        “And what about you?” She playfully inquired.
        “Bullies!”, their responses spilled out simultaneously, punctuated by hearty laughter, until Steey’s laughter was interrupted by a sudden cough, a small trace of blood appearing.
        “You need to rest.” She said, her tone carrying a hint of sarcasm.
        Despite the interruption, his laughter continued beneath him, since it’s one of the facts of all time. They slowly quieted down and stared at each other right in the eye for a few seconds, before they both turned away in embarrassment. Steey’s heart felt full and loved for the first time as it bursts like fireworks.
        
        “Retsamowt, it’s them, right?” The mother spoke to Retsamowt. She was in the living hall, with Retsamowt, Steey’s father, who was typing furiously on the computer.
        “Yeah. It’s them. They’re back.” Retsamowt spoke seriously as he pulled his fingers off the keyboard, the cold sweat in him rolled down his face, his voice giving off a sense of bad feeling as it lingered in his mind; Trying not to admit the fact that it was true.
        
        Chapter 14- Burdens Beyond Control: A Fate One Cannot Handle
        
        Fate is something one cannot change.
        
        A weapon, predetermined by god. It’s something that leads toward destiny and what we were meant to be in the first place. Some good, some bad, but either way it’s how things were meant to go, and it usually leads to something positive.
        
        Except that sometimes, it doesn’t.
        
        Steey’s life was finally full with both his parents by his side and, a girl that truly understood him and was most importantly, a friend and not a bully. It seemed like a good ending, for someone who had been constantly bullied in the past with his father wrongly jailed. Except in this case, it’s not.
        
        The years flew by fast, and he was now fifteen years old with the current year being 2023. Feels familiar? It’s the exact same age as the group of teens when the apocalypse happened, which happened in 2023. You can see where this is going…
        
        Steey once again changed schools, to the east this time, and it happened to be Rose’s school. Hence, they walked together to school every day for the past year. He’d come to the orphanage just on the way to school and wait for her, just so they could walk together to school and enjoy the calming abundance of the town. Not having any other friends, they became best friends. Luckily for Steey, there aren’t many bullies in this school. Instead, it was rather peaceful, except for a few dudes who like to troll their friends. But no one was hurting, no one was covered in blood, everything was chill.
        
        “Hey!” Steey waves to Rose, hovering for her to come over.
        
        The last bell chirped its cheerful tune, and soon it was the end of another
         day, as Steey waited for Rose to walk home together since it was Friday, and they were gonna have an epic battle on the PlayStation for Plants versus Zombies Garden Warfare 2. Rose looked over and started to approach. He stared across the distance, as Rose got closer and closer before someone approached her first. It’s a guy he sees, quite old-looking with a black cap and sunglasses that look seemingly familiar…
        
        But when he realized who he was, the guy struck Rose.
        
        The guy grabbed her arm and tried to drag her. The students were panicked beside them as they quickly walked away. Steey noticed the situation, and ran forward instead, in the opposite direction of everyone else. No, not happening again. He punched that guy’s neck, making him resist for a second in some confusion. Taking this opportunity, she ran away.
        
        “Come on!” She shouts, urging Steey to run on. The man shook his head back to reality and roared as he started pounding his feet towards them. As they ran, the man continued to chase behind them. It wasn’t long before some cops stopped him. Despite this, the two continued to run on, unsure about the safety and whether the cops were really on their side. They ran and ran, their hearts pumping the blood as it flew over their body. Their hands held tightly together as they ran side by side. No one is losing anyone.
        
        They eventually reached safety, Steey turned and looked around, making sure that there was no one looking before shutting the door tight. Restlessly breathing, the mother rushed in from the kitchen, alarmed by the sounds of the two. Her face showed fear and uncertainty as she entered. “Are you kids okay?” his mother asked, knowing something bad must have happened for Steey and Rose to run like this.
        
        “They’re back,” Rose said, as she managed to catch her breath. The mother’s expression hinted at her growing unease and fear.
        “I think it’s best you stay with us for now.” She said before she headed back to the kitchen, her face demonstrating a weird expression as she chopped the onions. 
        
        There wasn’t a single word said between everyone as they munched on their meals after the mother told Retsamowt about them being back for no good. The thought that they were back on the hunt made them lose their appetite. The onions feel soggy and the carrots feel as hard as a rock. Eventually, Retsamowt broke the silence. He slammed his palm onto the table and everyone’s attention was on him.
        
        “I think there’s something you all need to know.” He said.
        
        Before Retsamowt got wrongly accused ininto jail.
        
        In the capital city of Nepal, Kathmandu lies the beautiful scenery of the Himalayas, one of the most famous mountain ranges, holding Mount Everest, the tallest peak on earth. The air was refreshing and the sun would glow occasionally from day to day. In a city filled with mostly low and small buildings, there’s one building that seems seemingly taller and more modern than the rest. Mr Kythagoras is a wealthy and enigmatic figure, known by many for his successful business rag-to-riches stories that inspired many. Whenever people look at him as he stares out of his window, holding his coffee elegantly. From a poor boy born on the outskirts of Canada to eventually migrating to Nepal, building a successful business in such a poor country, selling packaged food to feed the people of Nepal. His success, however, was matched only by the air of the congeniality that surrounded him, much like the sweet connotations evoked by his Canadian origins and his current wealth.
        
        At Mr Kythagoras’ side was his loyal secretary, Retsamowt, a diligent and unassuming individual who appeared to thrive in the bustling world of business. Yet unknown to the world, Retsamowt carried a secret along with Mr.Kythagoras and “them”, one that could alter the course of humanity. A plan destined to change the plans to something greater.
        
        Amid the maple-scented corridors of power, Retsamowt was more than just a secretary; he was the bridge between Mr Kythagoras and a world far beyond. A world where secrets were whispered between galaxies and plans were woven into the very fabric of space and time. Mr Kythagoras possessed knowledge that transcended mere Earthly matters- knowledge that had been shared with him by “them” in exchange for information shared by him with “them”, a lot like Elon Musk.
        
        Retsamowt’s purpose had always been to serve the two parties, but as time passed, a growing sense of attachment to the human world began to take root within him. His eyes met a captivating human being that seemed more important than anything that ever mattered, and in that fleeting moment, the boundaries between his extraterrestrial origins and human emotions began to blur. It was a feeling he couldn’t ignore, a feeling that made him question his allegiance to the grand schemes woven by beings not of this world.
        
        The towering mountains, once a source of inspiration, now seemed to mirror Retsamowt’s internal struggle. He decided to confide in Mr Kythagoras, to reveal his feelings and intentions. In the end, the cards were laid. As he stood before the businessman, Retsamowt’s voice trembled, and he articulated his decision to step away from the path that had been laid out for him.
        
        “Umm, I quit…” Retsamowt started as he shared his truth, a storm brewed in the silence that followed. He placed his papers down and walked out the door, with something haunting him on his back. As days turned into weeks, into months which turned into years, the air grew with tension, Retsamowt’s mind never truly asleep from the past, unaware of his true fate.
        Until one day, tragedy struck the company. The very foundations of Mr Kythagoras’ empire trembled, and in the chaos, Retsamowt found himself ensnared in a trap he had never anticipated. His fate finally caught up to him.
        
        He walked through the icy steps of the courtroom, and reporters and journalists surrounded him, questioning him about the tax evasion that occurred in the company. Eventually, he was stopped by Mr Kythagoras, who influentially stopped the two escorters who were escorting the innocent criminal. In some way, he was looking down at Retsamowt as he grinned evilly with his shiny teeth.
        
        “Why?” Retsamowt pleaded, his mouth covered with a mask, his eyes felt with betrayal, as it pierced through the maple-sweet air and Retsamowt was cast aside, accused of crimes he hadn’t committed. The clouds of his past rained upon them.
        
        “You were no longer of use to us,” he spoke calmly, before closing in their distance.
        “If you say anything about the plan, you say goodbye to your wife and children,” he whispers, before gesturing for the escorters to take him away. The world's weight bore down upon him as he faced imprisonment, separated from his new family and the life he had dreamed of. Even as tears flowed, and pleas echoed through the corridors, the inexorable march of fate led him to an unescapable truth as he was marched to his cell.
        
        As time stretched onward, the winds carried whispers of an impending change, a revelation that would alter the course of Retsamowt’s life once more. But for now, the story remained suspended, waiting for its secrets to be unveiled in the distant future.
        
        …
        
        The room went quiet. The shock made the two have nothing to say. Especially for Steey, who felt a sense of regret for not knowing but also coupled with a small sense of betrayal toward his family for keeping it a secret. 
        
        “You good?” Rose sat beside Steey, whose feelings of uncertainty seemed to linger around the air, and Rose understood that feeling. She experienced it herself a bit too much…
        
        “Yeah.” He spoke, his voice shaky as he was being pulled by determination and betrayal.
        
        “By the way, why was he chasing you? Why is Mr Kythagoras trying to kill you?” He quickly changes the topic, trying to brighten up the mood.
        “I just happened to find out about his plan, I was chilling during nighttime in a dimly lit cafe, and a photograph slipped underneath my table. I picked it up and there was a map, a suspicious map that seemed to indicate a map of the world, but sorted in a weird structure. The guy, Mr Kythagoras, snatched it from me. Hinted at the existence of a grand design, I went researching, found out and snuck into the headquarters, saw his plans and managed to escape. But apparently, my luck ran out as I got caught by one of those security cameras.” Rose paused, her expression a mix of intrigue and concern, “So, that’s when I found out about his plans, and it seems to be the reason he wants me gone.”
        
        In response, he simply nodded, the gravity of the situation sinking in. The atmosphere that he was trying to brighten up shifted as the weight of their conversation settled, shadows dancing on the walls of the dimly lit room.
        
        “Project Above the Horizon.” Rose finishes.
        
        …
        
        “Don’t come back late!” were the four words that he heard his mother say as they walked out of the door.
        
        There was a duo competition for current events today. Usually, Steey would sink into the depths of sadness or not even care for team-based competitions. Social Studies wasn’t his cup of tea. However, with Rose’s presence, he is actually quite excited about it.
        
        “Begin!” the microphone splurted out, and Steey pulled out the A4-sized paper filled with questions from the brown envelope.
        “A!” Rose whispered, and Steey quickly wrote in. His eyes jolted down to the second question soon after. His expression of excitement turned into one of uncertainty. He looked beside him, Rose had an expression that he had never seen before, one so harsh and uncertain, like the eyes of a tiger. 
        “Let’s move on.” Steey quickly selected a random answer for that question. “Mr Kythagoras” his mind circled and red was seen and fists were seen. The guy that placed his father in jail, the guy that hunted Rose, and the guy that might cause harm to those around him anytime soon…
        
        What a horrifying feeling…
        
        Against the odds, they emerged victorious, propelling Steey to cloud nine with an overwhelming sense of joy. His eyes were seeing fireworks. Winning held a special significance to him, it marked his first-ever win in a duo competition, a true milestone. Not only that but most importantly, he won with someone special, multiplying his feeling of success. Driven by the desire to preserve this memory, he decides to keep the paper that brought them victorious. 
        
        Fate, however, has other plans. Regrettably, the teacher disposed of it, thinking someone just forgot to bin it as Steey, left it on his table as he turned to talk with Rose. The next moment he knew, the paper was gone and the teacher took the trash as she walked out of the classroom, only leaving Steey to watch the cruel teacher as he sighed in disappointment. The disappearance of something so cherished left Steey feeling robbed, as if a piece of his heart had been unjustly taken away, leaving a poignant sense of loss. The pain lingered, haunting him, until Rose stepped in with her comforting words. She gently reminded him that memories and triumphs are securely held within our hearts, immune to external forces. Steey was profoundly moved by her wisdom, his feeling of regret seemed to subside unconsciously.
        
        School ended quickly for them. In remembrance of his mother’s word, he urged Rose to go home first, as he had been caught up with a terrible stomach ache. Surprisingly, the stomach ache subsided as he sat on the toilet bowl. He pulled on his pants and turned on the tap. The door to the outside opened, revealing a dark, ghostly corridor that seemed to go on for miles. He set his foot out of the toilet before something unexpected happened.
        
        His eyes spun in shock as he felt something struck his neck. His legs went soggy, before eventually he collapsed to the cold ground.
        
        …
        
        “Wake up, dwarf!” A man spoke sarcastically, as he simultaneously slapped Steey. Steey’s eye slowly opened, revealing a man who seemed to be in his 50s. Behind featured a massive dark, old, and creepy warehouse. Something caught his eyes, as he stared at the figure behind the man; Mr Kythagoras, taller and younger than he ever expected, someone more formal than the bloody murderer he visualized in his head.
        
        “Move.” Mr Kythagoras commanded his henchmen, as he bent over to stare Steey eye to eye, looking down at Steey's quivering inner child. Steey pulled his arm, just to realise it was chained. In another fearful attempt, he kicked and tried to leap forward, only to realise that his legs had also been chained.
        
        “Look, I don’t want to make this crap complicated, just give me the girl…” He started calmly, but Before he could finish, Steey interrupted with an assertive “Never!”.
        “I don’t think you grasp the seriousness of the situation,” Mr Kythagoras persisted, getting out his phone to reveal a live footage. It displayed his mother engaged in an afternoon tea chat with Rose. The room fell into a tense silence as the significance of the scene settled in. It was a moment that carried implications beyond its surface, leaving Steey to contemplate the complexity of the situation.
        
        “Hand us the girl, or say bye-bye to both your mother and that father of yours, you wouldn’t want to end your reunion so abruptly would you?” he stated, his tone laced with a disturbing blend of passivity and aggression.
        
        “Let me think!” Steey shouted, the complexity of the situation leaving no room for a straightforward response.
        “You idiot, we wait for no one!” The bodyguard’s voice boomed at Steey, his words carrying the threat that he could kill everyone Steey held dear, which he might…
        “Let him think.” were the three words that saved Steey temporarily. In the end, he gave him a week, a fleeting respite; if nothing was answered within the time frame, mercy would be absent from his actions.
        
        Uncertain about what to do, he returned home. His mother wasted no time in questioning his lateness. As Steey walked toward his room, his mother stopped him in his tracks.
        
        “Why are you so late? I clearly told you not to be late this morning.”
        
        He sighed, trying to sound convincing. “Got lost without Rose’s navigation help.”
        
        The excuse fell flat, evident in his mother’s sceptical gaze. As minutes to hours to days went on, the unease had never escaped his mind, not for a single second. Rose, attuned to his emotions, sensed something was amiss. It wasn’t long before he mustered the courage to share his burden with her. There were 3 days left, it was now or never.
        
        “Rose,” he began hesitantly, “there’s something I need to tell you.”
        
        Concern etched her features. “What’s wrong?”
        
        He recounted everything, from the kidnapping to the threatening. Rose’s eyes widened in alarm as she processed the gravity of the situation.
        
        “This is not right,” she said firmly. “I’m the one that brought you to this. I can’t let you and your family bear this. I’ll give myself up,” she said assertively.
        
        Their conversation, however, was not as private as they thought. Steey’s parents had overheard, prompting them to gather everyone together. “Tell us everything,” his father demanded, his tone a mixture of urgency and concern. 
        
        Steey hesitated, then shared the harrowing details. His parents exchanged a worried glance before his mother spoke. “We need a plan. One that doesn’t involve sacrificing anyone, quick, there’s only 3 days left.”
        
        His father nodded in agreement. “But we have to be prepared for the worst. If necessary, I’ll sacrifice, but let’s see what other options we have first.”
        
        They brainstormed and went deep into their thoughts. As they discussed, a plan took shape. “China,” Steey’s father said, conviction in his voice. “It’s one of the few countries that accepts Nepali migrants. I will get our flights ready before tomorrow.”
        
        The wheels of the luggage scraped the floors. Amidst the chaos at the airport, tension hung in the air like a heavy cloud. Tourists desperate to visit the tallest mountain in the world walked through the airport in heavy oversized winter articles of clothingclothings. Steey, Rose, Retsamowt and his wife moved cautiously, their eyes scanning the surroundings as they navigated through the bustling terminal, spotting anything sus. The urgency of their situation was palpable, propelling them forward with a sense of purpose. This will all be over soon. It better be…
        
        Unknowingly, a silent presence lurked in the shadows – a spy, watchful and vigilant, tracking their every move. Despite their meticulous planning, they had overlooked the fact that they were being observed. As they neared the security checkpoint, hope flickered in their hearts. They were so close to escaping the clutches of danger and securing a new life. But just as they began to feel a glimmer of relief, chaos erupted.
        
        A sudden commotion drew their attention, and before they could react, shots rang out, and bullets rained, shattering the air with deafening cracks. Panic surged through the terminal as people screamed and fled in all directions. Amid the chaos, Steey’s parents were struck down, their lives abruptly taken by the violent intrusion.
        
        Time seemed to slow as Steey and Rose watched in horror, their world shattering before their eyes. The parents’ words echoed in their minds, “Run!” With tears streaming down his face, Steey felt a surge of desperation. He knew they had to honour his parents’ sacrifice and make a run for it.
        
        “Get them!” The guy in the middle said. Their dark masks covered the intrusers' faces. Steey heard one of his men urging the leader to escape, as footsteps of security grew louder and louder as every millisecond passed. They ducked the last few shots and sprinted toward the departure gates, navigating through the panicked crowd, before the shots were not even heard anymore.
        
        They approached the boarding gate, their breaths ragged and exhaustion setting in. The flight attendants hesitated, perceiving the urgency in their eyes. Without words, Steey and Rose presented their tickets, stepping onto the plane as distant sirens wailed.
        
        Anger boiled Steey like a kettle. Tensions hung heavy as Steey turned to Rose, his voice edged with accusation.
        
        “It’s all your fault!” Steey’s frustration erupted. “If you hadn’t come to stay at our house, if you hadn’t visited me at the hospital after the incident, if you hadn’t bumped into me in the first place.”
        
        Rose’s eyes welled up with a mixture of hurt and guilt as Steey’s words hung heavily in the air, each accusation driving a wedge between them. Rose’s eyes glistened with regret.
        
        “I know, Steey. I’m so sorry.” She spoke softly, a tear flowed down her cheek.
        
        The weight of their exchange settled between them, a silent acknowledgement of their shared pain. With a heavy sigh, Steey spoke up again. “Maybe it’s best if we go our own ways.” he gave her the stingy eyes and looked away. They stayed like that throughout the entire departure.
        
        The plane journey was marked by an unsettling quiet. Neither Steey nor Rose spoke throughout the whole journey, their minds preoccupied with the recent tragedy and the choices they had made. The hum of the engines provided a backdrop to their internal voices, each lost in their thoughts as the aircraft carried them onward to an uncertain future.
        
        The first plane ride of Steey ended without much excitement. His mind was too caught up and focused on the tragedy for him to feel even the tiniest spark of excitement. 
        
        “Hey.” Rose taped Steey. He came to his mind, just to realize the custom officer standing right in front of him in an impatient matter.
        “I got this,” Steey whispered in a harsh tone. They made it all the way out to the front of the airport without much trouble; the workers didn’t seem to care for much, being a rather busy hour at the airport.
        
        As they reached the outside of the airport, Rose glanced at Steey once more, but just as she expected, his eyes were dark dead, and so was his voice. “Goodbye,” Steey whispered as he turned and walked away, clutching his bag tightly. His lips remained sealed, and he refrained from saying anything more.
        
        “Stee-” Rose’s voice quivered with desperation, the syllables hanging in the air like a plea. She halted herself from continuing, as guilt laced her voice like poison. Her gaze lifted to a sign that read “Tea” accompanied by unfamiliar characters. Assuming it was a tea house, a place to find solitude and reflection, she stepped onto the bustling road, tears welling up in her eyes. Glancing back, Steey locked eyes with her, a silent exchange that conveyed a heartbeat of unspoken feelings. Uncertainty gnawed at him, battling against his moral compass. He hesitated, torn between reaching out and forging ahead.
        
        Just as he was about to avert his eyes and attempt to move forward, a deadening horn blared out loud. Time seemed to slow as Steey’s gaze snapped back to Rose. In an instant, her existence was nowhere to be seen other than the collision of metal and flesh. Crimson pools of red swallowed the grey concrete that used to lurk underneath vehicles. The sickening thud echoed in his ears as the world blurred into an abstract whirl of colours. He felt his heart shatter within him, the fragments piercing every inch of his being. It felt like he had been trolled by fate itself, robbing his last chance to mend the fracture between them.
        
        Shock held him in place for a suspended moment, an eternity of disbelief compressed into mere seconds. And then, he rushed onto the road, chaos and panic fading into a distant hum. His breath came ragged gasps as he fell to his knees beside her lifeless form. 
        Steey’s heart stopped for a beat, mirroring the stillness that had now enveloped her. A primal scream of grief and anguished echoed in the hollow spaces of his mind, but the world around him turned into a haze of static, edges of reality fraying. He felt powerless, his hands stained with the remainder of her soul.
        
        Paramedics soon arrived, confirming her demise, while the police presence grew. The truck driver that rammed Rose seemed to have fled. His attention shifted to a figure in a black suit and cap, engrossed in a phone call. Their eyes met briefly before the man hastily fled the scene. Driven by a surge of adrenaline, Steey pursued, yet amidst the chaos, law enforcement misunderstood and caught him.
        
        Confined to a temporary cell, Steey awaited for a translator. When the translator came, he recounted the truth to the police – they recently arrived from Nepal, the suspicious man who seemed to be observing them, perhaps an imposter. Authorities reassured him of their pursuit based on security footage, providing him with a sense of comfort before sending him to a nearby orphanage.
        
        As he approached the international orphanage, a lady greeted them and took Steey in. The children stared at him for a while, before the lady hinted at them to look away. Soon, they reached a wooden door, which the lady gently opened.
        
        “This is gonna be your room for now. Meet your new roommate.” She said as a figure appeared. A boy of similar age, blackish blond hair, and eyes that carried hints of blue amid the darkness.
        
        “Nice to meet you, roomie,” the boy greeted with a warm smile.
        “I’m Blakay.”
        
        Chapter 15- Of An Unwanted Curse
        
        “Catch Steey!” Blakay shouted, throwing the frisbee to him. Steey sprinted forward, the frisbee closing up on him from the back. He turned beside and his eye contact with the cone, before spinning around to face head-on with Frisbee. This is it. 
        
        A few guys ran in front of him, trying to knock the frisbee down from him. But the frisbee curved nicely from Blakay’s throw, avoiding all those kids. He pulled his hands forward in an attempt to catch the frisbee, but to his usual bad luck, the frisbee tapped the edge of his fingers, as it started to fall toward the ground. Steey makes a final dive toward the frisbee, managing to catch it just before the frisbee hits the ground.
        
        The team went wild, sounds of success and cheer roared beneath their souls. Blakay went toward Steey to give him a high-five, which he accepted without hesitation. They did it, they won the school frisbee championship. LET'S GO!
        
        Steey’s journey flipped to another chapter, as he started a new life in this once unfamiliar country. When he first arrived, he had trouble turning over a new leaf. He often ignored his roommate at the orphanage, Blakay. His mind was still more messy than his room, still thinking of his deceased parents. His heart is not allowing him to move on from the past. However, as Blakay consistently reached out to him, his heart began to waver. Blakay offered help with assignments at the new school, showed kindness by sharing extra food, provided constant motivation, and even stood up for him when he was teased by others much older than them about his height. No matter what, his hands were still there to pull him up back on track. He approached him and helped him so much when he never asked for it, when all Steey did was ignore him, attacking him verbally when he did talk back, it made Steey feel bad, his morale shredding himself by that unspoken kindness that was shown to him. It felt almost like the same tender touch as Rose, one that mended the emotional wounds he had suffered. Although this one feels slightly different, it felt like he was always there to protect him, like a brother. If only he treated Balake the same way.
        
        “I know there’s some good in you,” Blakay said one night to him before the lights went out for bedtime. The words circled in Steey’s mind like an endless echo. “No, I am not a good person,” he thought, the weight of his past transgressions pressing down on him as his back turned to his homie. The pain of losing his parents, a wound that had never healed, resurfaced with vengeance. Guilt consumed his insides as he remembered the circumstances surrounding their deaths, circumstances he had carried like an anchor around his neck.
        
        His heart ached as he reflected on the choices he had made, the mistakes he had committed - they were scars in his memories that would never fade away. He had blamed the girl and shifted his own guilt onto her shoulders.
        
        Tears welled up in his eyes as he acknowledged the truth he had been avoiding. “I’m a bad person,” he whispered, his voice trembling with self-condemnation. The weight of his remorse was crushing, a heavy burden he had carried for far too long.
        
        “What makes you think that?” Blakay overhears his silent whisper. Steey looked at him, before turning away, trying to hide his tears. Sensing a need for comfort, he patted him gently on his back.
        
        “You can tell me, I won’t force you to.” Blakay continues, trying to convince Steey in a soft, low voice.
        
        “What’s the point? He can’t relate to me…” Steey declines with hesitation in his mind. But then, he realised that Blakay also had a rather cruel fate. Just like him, he doesn't have any parents, yet he still smiles warmly. The smile pierced through the edges of the room’s darkness. A tear flew down his face, as he turned to face Blakay. He decides to disclose his private matter to Blakay, right from the beginning.
        
        It all began with his father being wrongly imprisoned after a wealthy businessman, named Mr Kythagoras, used him as a scapegoat to save his company. Eventually, his father was released, but their path crossed with an orphaned girl named Rose who was fleeing from Mr Kythagoras. She had stumbled upon a secret plan, and Steey had offered her shelter.
        
        For once Steey had finally had a friend, not a bully. He has been repeatedly bullied about his father coupled with his height in the past. If it wasn’t for Rose, he wasn’t sure if he would be able to communicate with others of age without getting trolled.
        
        However, in one fateful evening, Steey was kidnapped by Mr Kythagoras. He was threatened with live video footage stimulating his mother and Rose, who happened to be having a conversation in the dining room. Mr Kythagoras also brought his father out and threatened to kill his parents and him if she was not handed over in a single week.
        
        Steey eventually shared this hardship with the rest of his family and Rose. Eventually, they came up with a plan- fleeing to China. And so they did, but just as thought this would all be ending, a cruel twist of fate killed his parents. They have forgotten that Mr Kythagoras have sent spies to monitor them. So once Mr Kythagoras have been notified about their escape, he sends hitmen to stop them before it’s too late, which they half succeed.
        
        Steey and Rose made it onto the plane. Steey initially blamed the orphaned girl for their misfortune, but fate took another cruel twist when she was fatally rammed over by a truck in front of the China Airport- an incident that seemed to be orchestrated by no one other than Mr Kythagoras.
        
        Suspicion hung heavy as a shadowy figure watched from the sidelines. Steey rushed to the scene to find the lifeless body of the girl he had unjustly blamed. It was then that he realised he had been a pawn in Mr Kythagoras’s sinister game, making him question his own character. He ruled out his bad luck, believing that anyone he cared about ended up meeting the Grim Reaper at an unsettling end. 
        
        “But I haven’t died yet.” Blakay joked in an attempt to lighten the mood. Steey chuckled, a laugh he had not done in a long time. A laugh that truly blossomed their friendship.
        
        As their friendship continued to grow, Blakay introduced Steey to his friend group: Emily, Leo, and Mia. They welcomed Steey with open arms, making him feel like a part of their tight-knit group from the very beginning.
        
        With Blakay’s encouragement and the support of his new friends, Steey began to come out of his shell. He slowly started to trust people again and let go of some of the bitterness that stood between him and the rest of the world. The warmth of their friendship helped him realize that not everyone he cared about would possibly meet a tragic end. It made Steey feel like he wasn’t a jinx, that good luck would come from all those hardships.
        
        One day, as they watched a group of students playing ultimate frisbee on the school field, Balaky turned to Steey with a mischievous grin. “You know,” he said, “I think you’d be great at ultimate frisbee. You might not be able to snatch it from mid-air by your height, but you’ve got speed and agility for it.”
        
        “Shall we join then? I heard they have trials for it this Tuesday,” Emily questions the rest of the group. Steey hesitated for a moment, memories of previous sporting events and running made him feel unsure. Boy was track and field a nightmare. But with Blakay’s reassuring smile and the support of his newfound friends, he decided to give it a try. Together, the group managed to pass the trials and made it to the school’s ultimate frisbee team, and to his surprise, he actually excelled at it.
        
        The rush of the game, the team spirit, and the cheers of the crowds were all new experiences for Steey. It gave him a new sense of belonging and purpose he had never felt before. Ultimate Frisbee became his passion, and he poured his heart and soul into every match.
        
        As he quick-stepped through the grass to make incredible catches despite the figures that blocked him in his path, and you bet some were twice his size, and threw precise passes through the opponents to his teammates, Steey felt like he was finally free from the weight of his past. 
        
        It was all freedom and joy until the apocalypse started.
        
        “Steey! Steey! Wake up, man!” Steey’s eyes slowly widened at first, the unexpected light blinding him. After the heat and the voices and the brightness caught up to his senses, he opened his eyes immediately, the unexpectedness of the situation made his heart skip a beat. 
        
        The last thing that Steey managed to read on his watch is 17/10/23, 11:11
        
        The digital watch soon filled with static, before it turned black. Steey pushed his blanket aside and looked at Blakay. His eyes were filled with fear, one that he had not seen before. He’s arms taping and skimming through the cupboards and drawers, as he filled his bag with loot.
        
        “What’s going on?” Steey shouted as he chucked a small bag filled with candy to Blakay.
        
        “I have no idea!” He shouted back, his voice losing tone after every word. Massive sounds of footsteps hurdled above them. Steey looked up, the sounds getting increasingly louder and louder before the roof came coming down.
        
        Kaff Kaff. Steey constantly coughed. Blood was spit out of every cough. He pushed the heavy roof to where the beds used to be. Blakay? Steey rushed to the front, pushing away small bits of wood that trapped his path. He heard a faint “help” from underneath him. He quickly got off and together, they flipped the wood over, revealing Blakay’s leg horribly broken; the pieces of bones were seen from the outside, and blood and shredded skin along with whiteness covered the whole scene.
        
        “Oh my gosh, Blakay!” Steey panicked. He constantly looked left and right, his tragic past flooded his mind. Deaths. Unwanted deaths. Cursed deaths that occurred wherever he went.
        
        He reached out to help Steey stand, and Blakay managed to utter, “I’ll be okay,” though Steey could see the doubt in his eyes. With concern, Steey retorted, “You’re not okay.”
        
        In that tense moment, their attention was drawn to a grisly sight as pieces of flesh emerged from underneath that scattered wooden debris. Their disbelief was quickly replaced by terror as a group of zombies marched menacingly toward them. Without hesitation, they quickened their pace, with Steey offering support to Blakay.
        
        As they hurriedly walked through the burning corridors, the remains of the damaged building continued to crumble behind them, creating a cacophony of crashing wood. Their hearts pounded as they narrowly escaped the orphanage’s impending collapse. The world outside was no better than the inside, as zombies and weird creatures roamed around freely, and buildings were abandoned along with people turning one by one. They knew they had to find safety, and fast.
        
        “Look!” Blakay points at an abandoned white Honda. Weirdly convenient, but they’ll take it. They make a speed walk for it. The whole situation was so dire, extreme and chaotic that they did what they could to survive. Despite the fact that someone might get to the car before them, despite that this is illegal, despite that some zombies could be right behind them and chasing them, they still set their eyes on the car, the one and only symbol of hope, redemption and most importantly, survival.
        
        Also the car’s somehow unlocked without a key. Weirdly convenient again, but they'll take it.
        
        “Can you drive?” Blakay questioned Steey, who was carefully placing Blakay’s injured leg into the vehicle after Blakay was seated in the back seat. He chucked the bag of supplies before shutting the door and hurrying to the driver’s seat.
        
        “Well, I’ve played some rocket league when I was younger,” Steey recalled, but his face was in a struggle. How did he control the car again? “I don’t think that’ll help, we need a license” Balake noted and took out a piece of paper. “What are you doing?” “Drawing you.” “Why? So can we have a license?” “Precisely” Steey palmed his head. “For what?” He exclaimed, voice contaminated with sweat. “Come on, we don’t want to be caught by the police do we?”
        
        “Does that matter right now?” Steey questioned sarcastically, before just barely managing to reach the forward pedal with his small legs. “Come on…” he said as he struggled to press down the accelerator and look at the road. But when the thing finally went down, The car sped through the road. “Slow down Steey!!!”, screamed Blakay, but then he looked back at the horde of lifeless zombies. “Nevermind what I said…”
        
        After Steey and Blakay sped away from the disturbing scene at the orphanage, they continued their journey through the winding streets of the city. Tensions were high as they navigated past abandoned cars, debris, and the occasional stumbling of the undead.
        
        As they drifted around a corner, they stumbled upon a roadblock. Tanks, armoured vehicles and trained military personnel blocked the road, they wouldn’t take even the slightest risk that would put the rest of the country at risk. They were forced to turn back, but were advised about a hall for survivors to quarantine and that the country would provide essentials to the survivors there. They just have to go underneath that massive bridge.
        
        Meanwhile, in another part of the city, Mia, Leo, and Emily had been among the first to arrive at the massive hall in the international district. Shivering in their timbers, They joined the growing crowd of survivors anxiously awaiting news and shelter. Emily held the hand of her parents, wishing for the best.
        
        After Steey and Blakay were forced to turn back due to the roadblock, they were constantly circling around the city, trying to find a source of light and the hall. Minutes passed, and their journey was fraught with danger and uncertainty. Just as hope was beginning to disappear, Steey and Blakay stumbled upon the hall’s beakening light. Exhausted, injured, but alive. They were welcomed by the collective sigh of relief from their friends. Their faces lit up as they spotted their friends. For the two, the fears for their safety were finally laid to rest, for now.
        
        “My parents didn’t make it.” Leo sniffs and Emily comes to comfort the heartbroken Leo. Together, they settled on top of a large piece of picnic mat brought by Emily’s parents.
        “Same. Thank god Emily your parent made it though.” Mia continues, hiding her tears. It was obvious, they all had a loss. They constantly were constantly forced to shuffle in due to the increasing amount of people, as the massive hall slowly got filled with all kinds of people, just as expected of the international district.
        
        As days turned into weeks and then into months, the group’s existence in the massive hall of the international district became a grim routine. The once bustling gathering of survivors began to feel more like a prison. The supply of food was depleting, water was scarce and hygienic problems were starting to raise their ugly heads. Fear permeated the air as they anxiously awaited news of a possible return to normal that never seemed to come. People have left the hall group by group for the past couple of days in search of information, but none of them came back. Hope shimmered down as time went its way, their survival on the line, with their food supply coming to an end.
        
        One night, a breach in the safe zone’s defences occurred. Someone was already bitten and became infected, and soon enough, everyone will be… The undead surged through the barriers that once protected them all. Panic spread like wildfire as alarms blared, and the survivors were forced to scatter in all directions. Blakay and most of the group made it out safely, to their relief, but as Steey counted them up, his eyes widened. “Emily is still stuck in there!”. Everyone stopped in their tracks in their own shattered reassurance of escape. “Lobsters!” Leo angrily whispered and ran back to the shelter. Mia, alarmed by Leo’s sudden action, ran to him. “What on earth are you doing?” Mia shouted as she caught up. Leo turned to her with a determined look, his footsteps not slowing down. “I’m going to get Emily out of here…”. Meanwhile, in a corner of the shelter, Emily and her parents were being surrounded by red-eyed goblins looking at them, mouth-dripping lakes. Emily’s mother and father looked at each other as they agreed. It was in the chaos of that night that Emily’s parents made their heart-wrenching decision to leave their daughter behind, as they said one last goodbye to Emily and successfully threw her out of the massive horde cornering them. Leo and Mia then came in and dragged the heartbroken Emily out of the infested shelter as she watched back, seeing her parents being eaten up with absolutely no mercy. They came back to their little groupie, did a recount and then, the group of friends ran for their survival. 
        
        Emily turned to look at their parents one more time, just to see a horrifying sight of them getting bitten and slowly turning into one of them. Her mixed emotions caused her to shiver coldly as she looked down tearfully. As they ran, Steey realized something; the zombies were stronger, a lot stronger actually from when they first encountered them. It really worried him that they could only get stronger. Blakay, Steey, Mia, Leo, and Emily were among those who barely managed to escape, but they soon found themselves separated from the other survivors. The once-survivor community was torn apart, and each small group was left to fend for themselves. It was everyone to themselves from this point. After hours of hike, they reached a nearby forest which they thought was safe enough and sought shelter. Exhausted, they took a seat on a fallen tree, gasping for air as they took slurps of water.
        
        Emily breathed out a heavy sigh and hugged her knees, lying her head to rest. Blakay looked at her sympathetically, he knew what she had to go through. He sat down near her and smiled. “Hey, it’s alright” he spoke softly as he wrapped his warm arms around Emily. She turned her head to face Blakay’s comforting face. “Blakay, I’m so scared. I watched my parents… I watched them turn.” Emily spoke, her voice quivering.
        
        “Emily, I’m so sorry you had to go through that. I think everyone learns that the loss of a family is never a feeling we can make cake out of. But we should know that we should never give up, as it is possible to redeem a tragic past and break free from the limitations that are only perceived. We’ll rest now and then we can figure out what to do next. Don’t forget, we’re in this together, all of us.” Blakay replied softly. As they huddled together for warmth and comfort, Mia and Leo were never far away, offering their own words of solace and support.
        
        “We’re all scared Emily, we all are. But we’ll stick together and watch out for each other.” Mia said, her voice trembling.
        
        “We won’t give up hope Emily. We’ll keep trying.” Leo further comforted her, his eyes filled with undeniable sorrow.
        
        While they were trying to repair and help each other emotionally, Steey sat at the end of the branch, his mind racing through the weird observation that he had. He can’t figure this out; how are they getting stronger, but most importantly, how and where did this apocalypse happen in the first place? For little Steey, it was all a jumbled up monster he was trying to defeat, maybe he needed to lay off a bit. 
        
        Life in the wild was gruelling and unforgiving, but they clung to that little hope they had of one day reuniting with the rest of the world in a normal peaceful life. 
        
        Without them even realising, time sweeps by their feet, and 3 years have passed.
        
        Emily’s attachment to Blakay deepened as time passed, cementing their bond even further. He became her constant source of comfort and security in their harsh new reality, and she found solace in the unwavering support of her friend.
        
        They’ve done nothing to get back to life. All they did was survive, survive, and just barely, survive. Steey, feeling the weight of uncertainty and isolation, proposed the idea of exploring beyond the forest’s boundaries. Being low on food and essentials, the rest of the group agreed. It was now or never.
        
        “You sure about this?” Blakay questioned, his sense of fear and uncertainty made obvious. He’s got a bad feeling about this, his mind feeling a sense of thunder as if it is trying to stop him.
        “It’s the one and only way, trust me, it’s gonna work,” Steey replied without hesitation. Blakay shrugged, he trusts Steey. They packed the little weapons and water that they got, before they headed out to the unknown, as a team.
        
        Their journey out of the forest was harder than it was getting in. Overgrown trees and bushes clawed at their clothes, and the dense canopy above cast a perpetual twilight, making it difficult for them to navigate. Eventually, they made it out of the green, just to see the same loneliness that embodied the forest. Buildings were abandoned, and not a single soul was heard. Steey turned around to see the roadblock that used to be blocking them from moving on to the rest of the country. It was now nothing but torn cones and traces of red and dark slimy green. 
        
        They searched tens of buildings and vehicles, just to find a few cans of food. Steey urged the group to move on and not get daunted by their small findings. And so they did, searching into hundreds and eventually, reaching the other part of the city. The supposed sunset was covered by a sudden cloud of rain. It was already night, and they found enough food to survive just barely a year. LETS GO.
        
        “It’s time to turn back, Good job everyone,” Blakay spoke in success. Just as he turned around, Steey interrupted the whole group.
        
        “Wait!” Steey shouted, his eyes caught onto something unexpected. Along the buildings, there was a small bunker-looking structure that wasn’t there the last time they were in this part of the city. It was silver and looked rather newly constructed in comparison to the rest of the abandoned buildings. To many, it felt like a stupidly suspicious thing, but to them, It felt like, hope…
        
        Blakay looked around the bunker, realising the danger as he saw zombies lurking around it. He told Steey and the rest of the group about the danger, but Steey re-assured him and the rest of the group that this might be the hope of getting back to civilization, that this might be their one and only chance to finally see beings and even possibly, get back to the life it was before. The group had nothing much to say, Steey’s argument seemed to hold light.
        
        As the group made their frantic run towards the bunker, Blakay, struggling to keep up after a whole day's search for food, gasped for breath. He turned to Steey, his voice weak and trembling. “Steey, I don’t think I can make it much further. This… this was a bad idea.”
        
        Steey, his face etched with concern, replied urgently, “Hang in there, Blakay!” We’re almost there. Just a little further, and we’ll be safe.” Blakay stumbled, nearly collapsing, but Steey and the others helped him back up. The zombies came closer and closer, as they regained their speed. Blakay was using up all his energy, until eventually, his leg caught a horrible cramp, and he tripped over into the cold concrete.
        
        Knowing his fate, Blakay urged them to carry on. Before Steey can turn back and encourage Blakay, it is too late. The group grew a shocked expression, a member had fallen, and soon would the family. The zombie bit Blakay, but instead of gasping to death, he smiled warmly at Steey and the rest of the group.
        
        “Wish you all luck…” 
        
        The doors of the elevator shut tight, leaving everything on the outside aside. Steey looked up with tears glimmering in his eyes, his head whispering, “So long brother…”
        
        …
        
        The rain outside poured relentlessly as the group huddled together in the elevator, still in shock from Blakay’s sudden death.
        
        Emily, her voice trembling with anger and grief, turned to Steey. “This is your fault, Steey! You convinced us to leave, and now Blakay’s gone, he’s gone!”
        
        Steey, his face a mask of sorrow, responded, “I never wanted this to happen, Emily. I thought it was our best chance to survive.”
        
        Leo, who had always been the quiet one, wept silently. He couldn’t find words to express his sorrow or defend Steey.
        
        Mia, the voice of reason, tried to mediate. “Emily, blaming Steey won’t bring Blakay back. We all agreed to this. It was a collective decision, and we all knew the risks.”
        
        Much to her effort, Emily’s blood just kept boiling. Instead of trying to find inner peace, and she lashed out. “No, Mia! It’s always like this when Steey is around, Don’t you know his past? Everyone he cares about dies. He’s a curse, and I don’t want to be near him and possibly die to that stupid curse of yours, Steey!” she turns to Steey, her face and tone unfamiliar to everyone.
        
        Tears streamed down Steey’s face as he kept repeating, “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” but it fell on deaf ears, with the group’s back watching. He felt the weight of guilt, wondering if this was how Rose had felt when he blamed her for his parents’ death.
        
        In the end, the group left Steey behind, his apologies echoing in the distance as they continued their journey without him. Steey was left alone, grappling not only the harsh wilderness but also the burden of his perceived curse, a curse that seemed to follow him relentlessly, taking the people he cared about with it. 
        
        Steey, grappling with the intense guilt that had become a constant companion, began to internalize the belief that he was a curse, bringing death to those around him. This dark accusation wasn’t without cause; he had lost not only Blakay, but also his beloved parents and even the first-ever friend he had, the first time someone had truly understood him and stayed by his side, Rose. All to a cruel fate that one should never ever have to experience.
        
        As he walked through the dark corridors of the underground city, his isolation weighed heavily on him. The accusations of being a curse haunted him, and he couldn’t help but believe them, despite his best efforts to push them away. Day after day, thought after thought, the curse seemed to have no cure, And so, he trained in the darkness, hoping to one day find vengeance, despite the impossibility.
        
        For now though, he remained undetected in the underground city’s eerie silence, navigating the shadows and grappling with his own inner demons as he questioned the meaning of his existence in this new, harsh world.
        
        Maybe the only way to end this is in a bloodbath.
        
        Chapter 16- Versus 496
        
        It can’t be…
        
        It just can’t be real.
        
        5 years?!?!
        
        His heart just skipped a beat. His face emotionlessly stared in disbelief at the futuristic skyscraper towering menacingly above.
        
        Arriving in the underground city of China from a void was something a bit too random, Steven seems to think that too.
        
        He clenched up his fist and dashed out through the door, skimming through the two girls.
        
        “Wait!” The older girl yelled at Steven. But it was too late, he was far gone.
        
        “You stay here,” she tells her sister, before running out to catch up to Steven.
        
        To his surprise, he ended up in a poorly renovated apartment lobby. He was surprised that that small room was the only room in the house. But he only shook his head out of the clouds, no time to be curious about that now. 
        
        After he reached the ground, he looked around in uncertainty. He is still in disbelief about five years having already gone through, but the amount and size of the skyscrapers back up the girl’s fact. Even so, he hovers around the busy streets in the hope of finding a path that leads above, back to the actual ground. Even if it’s just a small chance, as long as there’s a chance that they’re alive, he is willing to do anything to get back to them where he belongs.
        
        “Wait up!” the voice from behind him carried to his ears.
        “Go back, saving me is enough!” he yells back at her, urging her to stop chasing after him.
        
        In front over a distance, a large set of stairs is made visible. The stairs lead to a mud-covered structure, with a set of elevators stretching above the structure through the ground above them.
        
        That has to be it.
        
        Being quite a distance, he pulls his hand out to the road, urging a taxi to pick him up. Once he was picked up, he pointed in front toward the mud-covered structure, signalling the driver his destination. The driver then said something in another language that he couldn’t understand, before putting his hand flat toward Steven in a position that’s like “Give me money first.”
        
        Damn it.
        
        Knowing that he didn’t have any cash, he stood out of the taxi. He attempted to make a sprint toward the structure, but the girl caught up and with a strong grip, pulled him aside to an alleyway.
        
        “Are you out of your mind!” She whispers sharply as she catches her breath. Steven, half coughing, decided to stop and tell
        “Who the you? You don’t look like you’re from here?” A man in a blue shirt questioned Steven from the main walkway.
        
        “Run!” was the one word the girl exclaimed before dragging Steven along with her. Uncertain about the unfolding situation, Steven hesitated, his steps gradually quickening until he finally pulled away from the girl’s grip. With determination to find out, he pushed her away gently and jogged towards the man who was chasing him. “Get back here!” He yelled sharply at them before shouting something else in another language. The man realising that Steven not getting away, continued walking until he was just metres away from Steven, before stopping and communicating with a man behind him in a similar outfit carrying a tablet. Steven started speaking panically, as he sprayed out questions on hopefully getting out of this underground city. The man didn’t seem to have taken a single word out of Steven, just fiddling his small bag for something…
        
        After a few seconds, the man pulled out a gun that looked too plastic, almost like a toy. But before Steven even knew, a quick and tiny projectile headed to his left arm. Steven felt a sense of shock in realising that he had been shot. The wound wasn’t deep, more like a needle prick. The person tossed a scroll toward Steven and walked away with the other guy. Steven lay there for a while, his eyes were twitching, with loading circles in his pupils..
        
        The girl caught up to Steven with a disappointed expression and began to explain everything as Steven unrolled the scroll. It turned out to be a forced invitation to a survival competition, and the scroll contained instructions in multiple languages. Steven quickly found the English section and began reading it as the girl elucidated further.
        
        According to the contents, Steven was selected to participate in a battle royale fight, a week from now, where more than one hundred teams entered and only one could leave. Teams of four would be chosen before the competition, and the teams were up to the participants. The competition involved approximately 500 people who would land on a designated map above the ground, search for weapons and necessities, and strive to be the last team standing. The location was the central show colosseum in the south of the city, but this was only a gathering point. 
        
        The Colosseum served as a meeting place, where contestants would be transported to the designated battleground. The girl explained that Steven’s outsider status had led to his selection. She had tried to save him by attempting to drag him away earlier, which Steven had realised too without her stating it.
        
        The event served as entertainment for locals and the wealthy, aimed to reduce the underground population, and sought to gather data on survival strategies against the zombies to help improve the government’s countermeasures. It’s like he along with other foreigners has been sacrificed. “I wonder how Elijah would have thought of that…” Steven thinks and reflects on his old friend who was always sacrificed in a funny way. But he realises that he might not be here anymore, which causes a feeling of depression to stab him deep in his stomach. 
        
        As a one-time annual event, the winners would be granted a wish, and they would no longer be considered a foreigner while most importantly, not dead like the other competitors. Through the scroll, Steven discovered that the gunshot wound contained a tracking device that also had a self explode sequence built into it. He swiped away sweat beads off his face as his eyes continued to feast onto more death threats. This is apparently used to ensure contestants not escape and allow the headquarters to monitor their locations and survival status.
        
        With a mix of shock and determination, Steven realised he had a week to prepare for a deadly competition that held the key to both his survival and a wish that could change his fate, from an impending death to something extraordinary.
        
        “Above the ground?” Steven questioned, undesires to acknowledge his fate but aware of this harsh reality.
        
        “Yeah.”
        “Isn’t that where THEY are?”
        “Unfortunately, yes. I literally chased you for more than a hundred meters, but you, on the other hand, messed it up.” She speaks in a rather sarcastic tone, hiding her feelings of being mad but sorry for him at the same time.
        
        Steven was at a loss for words, uncertain about what to say or do at this point. His throat was always near death’s scythe, and with this Hunger Game like competition waiting for him, now even the scythe was starting to touch his bare skin.
        
        “I think we need to have a chat. Follow me.” She signals Steven to follow her. Unsure of what to do, he follows her, his hand firmly gripping his obsidian with questions beyond what he could process. First though, he needs to know more about this place.
        
        …
        
        They eventually settled by a seat at a cafe.
        
        “I think we should go back to the start. My name’s Celestia, nice to meet you, strange kid.” She speaks confidently. Steven opens his mouth in desire to answer and tell her about his name, but a waiter approaches them and speaks in a foreign language. Celestia quickly replied to the waiter in that foreign language that he didn’t understand, before turning back to him.
        
        “What are you saying again?”
        
        “My name’s Steven, it’s a pleasure to meet you,” Steven replies unfocused, his mind captured in the fantasy and cyber-futuristic city. This whole place was unfamiliar to him, and everything was coming to him too quickly for him to process. Just minutes ago while he was conscious, he was battling the sea-creature boss. Yet, now he found himself in an underground city, pulled into a fight for his life.
        
        “Me and my little sister, Calista, found you unconscious on a beach outside on the ground last week while we were fishing. We can’t just leave you out there, so we took you in.” She speaks, capturing Steven’s full attention. With pure sight, sources of construction can be seen, as more structures were constructed in all corners of the city. Judging by the size of Celestia’s home, he can tell that the city is currently too dense.
        
        “That doesn’t make any sense.” Steven deflects her answer.
        “How?” She questions in suspicion of Steven’s thoughts.
        “The last time I was really conscious, I was battling the mastermind behind all this. And that was just about a week after the apocalypse started. But you said that it was now 2028.” Steven explained as if Celsstia had just been exposed. Celestia however, does not seem offended or scared. Instead, she laughed.
        
        “What the chickenisia are you talking about?” She jokes, making Steven blush but half mad at the same time. Steven looked around the walls of the cafe in the hope of finding a calendar, which he did find with the year 2028.
        
        “I know it sounds like a joke with the whole me skipping five years and me as a teenager fighting a villain. But I tell you, it’s real, whether you believe it or not.” Steven finishes off. Celestia wiped away a tear of laughter.
        
        “Whatever you say.” Celestia stands up from her seat.
        “We can’t stay seated for any longer if we are not gonna order any drinks.” She says, but Steven is already embarrassed enough to say anything more about it.
        
        Steven followed Celestia to her home. As they were walking, a few strangers stared at them since it was unusual to have a local walking with a foreigner, especially teenagers to speak.
        
        “Once we get back, I will grab my stuff and leave,” Steven speaks firmly, unwanting to develop any further conversations with her.
        
        “You don’t have to say that. We are planning to kick you out once you wake up anyway. We can’t afford to spend any more cash on you.” She closes the conversation, putting the rest of the journey back into complete silence.
        
        They took the elevator up to the apartment. It steadily increased until eventually, it bumped to a stop at floor level 21. The doors opened, and they walked out to along corridor consisting of many different rooms. To their surprise, the door to Celestia’s home is wide open.
        
        As they walked through the opened door in suspense, the lights turned on. A woman with a knife was sat right next to Celestia’s sister, Calista. Her hand held down Calista’s hand firmly and her blood red eyes staring dead at Celestia's eyes. Steven felt a sudden freeze, and he could only stare in a catatonic stupor. Celestia took a step back, bumping into Steven.
        
        “We don’t have to do this mother.” Celestia said, her voice shaky, yet firm and fierce as she pulls her hand out in a stopping position. Her eyes went red and her expression got to a mix of fear and anger.
        “Mother?” Steven thoughts. He turned and moved slightly to be facing at the right of Celestia, his heart filled with desires of answers.
        
        “Oh yes we do Cely, I have to survive too! Don’t you think that running away from me will get you out of this you little monkey!” The woman pleaded aggressively.
        
        “Give me the damn money, NOW!” She shouts, her hand gripping the knife even more firmly. Suddenly, she sent the knife at Calista’s hand, the knife entering the shallows of the skin, eventually releasing drops of redness. Calista looked like she was about to cry, but she held her tears. She just looked at Steven like a sad and abandoned puppy, seeking for help. Steven looked as if he was about to cry, but it wasn’t that kind of crying. He wanted to do something, no, he needed to do something. How can one just allow such violence to occur, especially from an adult to a young kid who doesn’t even look like she was ten. That voice inside him shouted at him, and that will of his was waiting to burst into action. His body however, refused to budge another inch, waiting for way less important answers. 
        
        “STOP! I will give you the cash.” Celestia starts fiddling with her right pocket, just to find it empty.  
        
        “HURRY UP!” The mother demanded. Celestia places her other hand in her other pocket, which she eventually grabbed out a handful of notes and coins.
        
        “Here! This is all I have!” Celestia holds out the money in an attempt to give the mother and save her sister, but another hand grabs her before she can do it.
        
        “So this is where you got your money huh,” a man’s voice said. Not even realising, a group of gangsters showed up right by them. 
        
        “We will take over from here. Thanks for the cash. You girls will be giving money directly to me now from now on.” The man said, his massive belly abrupting the tiny space. He seems relatively moderate in height and seems to be from the west. The mother looks more shocked than ever, as she holds the knife tighter than ever at Calista. Calista couldn't help but to give her older sister a “help me please” impression.
        
        “Move one more step and I will kill her!” The crazy woman shouted, her eyes starting to show signs of fear and desperation. 
        “Do you really think that I give a crap?” The man sweared. The man behind him started moving toward the lady. One of them pushed Steven to the ground, as he landed on his butt facing the situation mixed with negative emotions and felt weak, incapable, and useless. He just sat there like an aimless teddy bear, and a woman appeared outside in curiosity. She peeked into the whole situation going on in the room, which is weird. 
        
        Feeling the uselessness of the hostage, she released Calista, who tried to run towards her sister. Celestia moved slightly toward Calista in an attempt to cover and protect her sister, but unfortunately, one of the gang members got her first.
        
        “You ain’t going nowhere, kid,” the man said and grabbed her. The woman slowly moved backwards, but there wasn’t much room to retreat to. Despite her knife held out front, it wasn’t long before the gangsters turned it into a bloodbath.
        
        The violence and bloody scene is unbearable. Despite the fact that her mother tried to kill her sister, Celestia still got emotional. What could you expect? She was literally her mother despite all the pain she gave her. Also, she now knows why her mother was being so aggressive all these years of the apocalypse; it was all because of the gangsters, they threatened her mother all these years for cash. Even so, underneath the tears Steven realised an underlying sad smile drawn across her mouth.
        
        Celestia tried to break the man to save her sister. But to her failed attempt, she got slapped hard in the face by the man. Despite this, she attempted again. This time though, the man pulled out his gun.
        
        “I heard that the government gives slightly more money to disabled kids.” He spoke ever so casually maniacally.
        
        The barrel of the gun trembled with the weight of impending doom, its cold, metallic mouth threatened to swallow Celestia’s last hope. Steven, sitting there with haunted eyes, couldn't stomach the looming tragedy unfolding before him. The future, drenched in bloodshed and violence, seemed to mock any semblance of peace he dared to imagine.
        
        His soul, already shattered by the loss of his family and friends, now teetered on the precipice of complete despair. It was as if the very fabric of his being was unraveling, and the threads of his sanity frayed to the point of breaking. The black hole he had unwittingly unleashed upon himself, a vortex of grief and guilt, threatened to consume what little remained of his shattered existence.
        
        The impending moment felt like the final verse of a tragic symphony, a crescendo of suffering that deafened the ears and numbled the heart. The man’s finger, a cruel conductor of fact, inched inexorably toward the trigger, dragging Steven and Celestia deeper into the abyss.
        
        As the man’s finger brushed against the trigger, preparing to release the unforgiving force within, a sudden blur of movement caught him off guard. Steven, driven by a desperate instinct, moved with an otherworldly speed, a spectral echo of the dark obsidian that unleashed the very black hole that abandoned his loved ones.
        
        The man’s eyes widened in shock, a momentary pause in the symphony of despair. Steven, like a fleeting spectre, pushed the man’s arm thereby intercepting the trajectory of the impending tragedy. His movement was so swift that time seemed to momentarily warp, and the man found himself frozen in disbelief. It was as if the ethereal force of grief had manifested into a guardian, swift as the wind but burdened with the weight of immeasurable sorrow.
        
        In the suspended moment, the trigger was pulled, and the deafening bang still resonated in the air. Yet, against all odds, Celestia remained unscathed. The man, his hands trembling, stared at Steven with a mix of astonishment and horror. The reality of Steven’s intervention, a desperate attempt to rewrite the script of their shared tragedy, hung in the air like a heavy fog.
        
        But the swiftness of Steven’s actions couldn’t erase the pain drawn across his face. His eyes, haunted by the ghosts of his past, told a story of a man who had outrun the speed of his inner demons but couldn’t escape the shadows they cast. Steven maintained his pose and eye contact to the man with the gun, his eyes filled with determination and anger as he shouted determinedly.
        
        “ENOUGH!”
        
        Chapter 17- Eclipsed Enigma
        “What the F#” Before the man could finish, Steven pushed the guy to the wall, bashing it to eventually reveal the woman standing outside peeking in previously. Shocked, she drops her phone and runs away. Celestia looked at them in disbelief. That masterful throw and inhuman strength of a man definitely had caught the Bosses eye. Seeing his gang mate get thrown to the wall, he turns his attention to Steven. His plump finger pointed at the agitated boy, who was ready for bloodshed, “Get him!’ he commanded and his men started to leap on him. Steven whips out his sword from the side and gives it a masterful spin, even stunning the boss himself, and zooms through two of them at once. It’s like a fairy tale, he just magically can slice through people even though he is no professional swordsman. The obsidian glowed abnormally, catching the attention of Celestia. Steven wasn’t thinking much at this point, it’s like he has been mind-controlled. 
        
        As he watched in horror as his men fell down into two pieces, one by one as the boy continued to show his inner anger, he knew his only option was to flee. But just as he approached the destroyed wall to escape, a group of police officers stopped him and cuffed him up. The obsidian slowly lost its shine and Steven dropped to the floor, his face showing his exhausted state. He looked up to the ceiling in relief, breathing heavily in disbelief. For some reason, Celestia went to talk with the policeman who was talking to Calista. After a while, her expression demonstrated a state of annoyance and failure, before walking toward Steven, who just needed a few more minute’s rest..
        
        “We have to get to the station.” She spoke.
        
        At the station, Celestia helped Steven and Calista speak to the policeman. It wasn’t long before Calista was shot with the same thing that shot Steven. The policeman attempted to give Celestia the similar scroll that was given to Steven. However, she declined it and spoke something, before signalling Calista something. The fact that Calista was given the shot confuses Steven since he thought that the shot was only for foreigners for the battle royale. However, his actions in the apartment outreaches his curiosity over that. He stared at the obsidian that was handed down from his friends who sacrificed. What the hell is this thing?
        
        As they reached back to the apartment, before Steven could question about Calista getting shot, Celestia questioned him first.
        
        “What is that thing that made you like Superman?” She asked. Her eyes feel teary as if she was holding back her tears. The smile that she portrayed seemed real, however.
        
        “Why was Calista shot?” Steven questions Celestia. Calista was back in her room, pondering about the endearingly shallow future.
        “Because of stuff, you know…” She said, unanswering Steven’s initial question. Her expression was however contrasting, holding back Steven from questioning any further. Hence, he decides to answer her.
        
        “My friend umm gave me this stone, which is from another friend, who got it passed down from his ancestors,” Steven explained. 
        “Why would anyone give you such a powerful family heirloom?” She suspiciously questioned, her mind turning to this territory from the previous negative thoughts. Steven stayed quiet, stuttering every time he tried to start answering. Being stuck unanswered, Celestia asks another more direct question.
        
        “First things first, where is he now, those friends of yours.”
        
        Steven opened his mouth for answers, but he had a lump in his throat. Memories were getting back to him, and his eyes shifted away from Celestia, holding back his flooding tears. Celestia realising this, starts to feel uncomfortable, sensing a wave of powerful dark energy.
        
        “They were, they were gone…” He begins. Having no one to let out on any more, he decides to trust Celestia. He started from the beginning, he and his friends meeting those kind military people at the warehouse, taking a plane to America for safety, the breach of America’s defence, getting on a boat to Underneath after the sacrifice of E-man, who had the obsidian to start with. The fight and realisation of betrayal from Oliver after the death of Noah, the death of Xander, who gave the obsidian upon to Steven himself. Seeing his parents die with his own eyes, the anger and inexpressible feeling that caused the release of the black hole, leading to the abandonment of his friends to the present day.
        
        Upon hearing his confession, Celestia realises the cruel reality of society given upon this apocalypse. The fact that not just herself, but people around the globe who have lost someone, fought for survival, abandonment and betrayers. But what people don’t realise is that all of this is stumbled upon by the apocalypse. The fact that all this fear, betrayal, depression, and other negativity was all caused by Underneath.
        
        “Now answer me.” Steven changes the topic, trying to hide the obvious of his past.
        
        “Umm, well she was not purely from China.” She explains her sister was not her biological sister, but was her step-sister. She tried to sneak her in but was however caught. At this point, Steven realized the reason behind how Celestia’s mother could bear her cruel actions against Calista; she was not her biological mother.
        
        “How can you speak English then?” Steven questioned, trying to answer his curiosity step by step.
        “Calista’s father became my stepfather after my father divorced my mother. He can speak English since he lived in the States for a while.” Celestia paused to take a second breathing before she continued.
        
        “He taught me the language, stating that it is important for us to learn it since it has become an important language to learn, judging the fact that it is often considered as ‘The global language’.” She explained. Upon looking at Steven’s stone, something useful appeared in her mind.
        
        “I know a friend whose uncle’s sister-in-law’s grandmother’s nephew’s friend opened the last stone collection museum in the world.” She spoke like it was nothing, leaving Steven devastedly curious and confused. He doesn’t even know the in-laws of his uncle, let alone his uncle’s in-laws’ grandparents’ nephew’s friends, he doesn’t even know if his uncle’s in-laws’ grandparents have a nephew. Seeing his confused expression, Celestia realises and assures him.
        
        “You see, relations in China are very important, not that I do know any relatives after this apocalypse, but I know the ‘friend’ since he only lives a couple of minutes walk away.
        
        Without further questions, they went to find the man
        
        “Ahh, settlers. Of course the Europeans.” The man spoke in understanding.
        The two of them stared intently at the old man, desiring for answers.
        
        “Andle you say, I think I had an archive of it. Wait here, I will go find it.” The old man spoke. With his accent, Steven could barely make out what he was saying, which is when Steven realized something odd.
        
        “Celestia, what was that smile during that bloodbath?” He questioned her, unwanting to accept the fact that she might be an undercover psychopath. She blushed a bit and looked out toward the back until the old man was completely out of her sight.
        
        “My father was a very kind man.” She started. Steven relaxed a bit, loosening his posture and listened.
        
        “He worked in the military. Despite that it is something honourable, it is also something that caused problems I supposed to the family, needing to be stationed at times, leaving us behind, the anxiety that caused me and my mother of the fact that he might never return from a screech of a gunshot and a whole lot of other things, you know,” she takes a sip of her water bottle, took a few deep breaths to calm her heart and carried on.
        
        “But just being in the military or being my father doesn’t make him my hero. It’s because of his kind yet strong heart. He once told me that as long as you keep up a smile, you will live a life that you are satisfied with. He also told me how a smile is better than going full berserk and making things even worse and sad when things are already downright horrible. Unlike some great philosopher or those rich and successful punks who say anything that sounds cool, he kept his word no matter the circumstances, which is what truly makes him admirable,” she finishes. Upon listening to Celestia, all he could think was “wow that’s deep…”
        
        “Hey, can you promise me something?” She questioned with her face turned away from Steven. Her hands covered her eyes and a smile was drawn across her face.
        
        “Anything, you and Calista literally saved my life,” Steven answered, deep down feeling a bit afraid of the promise.
        
        “Can you guarantee my sister’s survival?” She turned back to see Steven eye to eye, as her eyes felt a bit watery. Despite this, she kept her smile, contrasting the rest of her face.
        In realisation of the simplicity yet gravity of the promise, he smiled confidently at Celestia.
        
        “Don’t worry, I got this.”
        
        Their conversation was interrupted as the old man walked out of the store with a book in his hand.
        
        The old man delicately flipped open the ancient book, revealing intricately detailed drawings and texts written in a language Steven couldn’t understand. He took a moment to scan the pages before turning to Steven.
        
        “If you don’t mind, can I purchase it at whatever price you name?”
        
        “It’s not for sale!” Steven yelled a little too loud, as the sound echoed through the quiet store. His neck shortened with embarrassment. Instead, the man just chuckled lightly.
        
        “My bad, it’s from someone important, I suppose?”
        
        “Yeah.” The weight of the family heirloom’s history hung in the air. Ethan entrusted Xander with his precious relic, a treasure that has been passed down for generations. Xander sacrificed himself to protect Luxury, who, in turn, trusted Steven with it despite the necklace itself being a token of their soul, the souls that died instead of her.
        
        The old man nodded in understanding and began translating the ancient text to Steven.
        
        He’s gonna need this thing.
        …
        
        1549, October.
        
        The world teetered on the brink of chaos. The mighty T-rex had evolved into the Azbocasorous, a smaller yet resilient species capable of enduring the extremes from scorching lava to the icy grip of the ice age. Passivity and an instinct to flee predators defined their existence.
        
        Surviving the dinosaur extinction, they adapted, growing physically stronger to fish for food in a world where most plants had vanished. With the arrival of humans, many Azbocasorouses fell prey. The absence of predators during the extinction and ice age left their survival instincts weakened, and most succumbed to the changing times. Most of them died off, unable to evolve with the times. When all hope is lost, one particular group of them survives miraculously. Mutation was on their side, and they mutated and evolved into a being like none other.
        
        They avoided humanity, built great civilizations, and progressed at an unprecedented pace. By 200 AD, they established planet-wide communication, and by 450 AD, they had landed on the moon.
        
        Their population began to stabilise, and they lived in harmony.
        
        However, the world has other plans.
        
        As human civilizations grew, they began to face problems. With both sides increasing in size, it is now harder to avoid conflict between the two beings. Azbocasorouses tried to evade conflict by building walls or establishing new civilisations away from humans, but space ran out. Humans, armed with weapons like swords and bows, posed a threat. Many Azbocasorouses perished in their attempts to avoid conflict.
        
        Their population started to decline until eventually, a generation of modern Azbocasorouses rose from its ancestors. Humans know them as “Kungtrue”.
        
        The Kungtrue developed weapons, starting with the staff in 1020 AD to the rifle in 1100 AD. With advanced technology, they overcame human resistance, resulting in mass killings in the 1350s, cleverly disguised as the Black Death in modern history. By the 1360s, their global dominance became widely known to all of mankind. Soon, the Azbocasorouses established a world capital in Andle.
        
        In the 1400s, the Chinese managed to steal a new element resembling obsidian from them. By the 1430s, they had it figured out and harnessed its unique powers. To be efficient and infiltrate the capital, they gifted it to a small village in Andle to save humanity, ultimately leading to the destruction of the capital. As a fleeting attempt, they built spaceships and flew away far into space, never to be seen by humanity ever again. As a token of gratitude, they decided to let the Andlenese people keep it.
        
        The old man continued, “It says that there are three pieces of obsidians left in the world. So you have one here, hmm.” hello
        
        “Do you know this tower?” The old man reveals an image featuring a tower to Steven, one that is very familiar to him…
        
        “Yeah, it’s the Clouds Tower, located in the middle of New City. Why?” Steven questioned in curiosity.
        
        “There is something, a relevancerevealance to a secret, a secret that’s only known to those who fought the Azbocasorous in the past. It’s located underneath this tower, God knows how deep.” the old man sighed. “I doubt you can get there now though, it’s so far away.” 
        
        Grateful for the information, they thanked the man and walked out of the store.
         
        Knowing how such a stone helped save humanity, he knew what he had to do now. But there was something he had to do first.
        
        For the last couple of days before the battle royale, he exercised and trained in the hope of controlling this power. To his luck, he hasn’t been able to control it. However, he could feel his physique getting stronger.
        
        On the dreadful day, they were at the entrance of the cumbersome building. “You two better make it out of there alive, you hear me!” Celestia said a final goodbye, with a powerful smile on her face despite the teardrop from her eye. Steven waved back and gave her his word, holding onto Celestia’s step-sister’s hand tightly.
        
        The next thing he knew, he was in the middle of a colosseum, where the crowds of people were surrounding them, cheering, booing and some more cheering. To his side is Calista, Celestia’s little sister, whom he had promised to take care of. A set of rules was shown on the large screen located in front of them. Every minute, it switched to a different language. At one point, he stumbled across a familiar language. His eyes quickly ran across the screen. Just in time, he managed to finish reading it before it switched over to another language. After a while, the screen went dark.
        
        The chaos in the colossal arena reached a fever pitch as the speakers blared, “You have a minute to form a squad! There are 700 of you, and only 125 squads will be accepted. Good luck!” At this moment, the screen up-front switched to a large display of a 1-minute clock. His eyes turn red.
        
        The urgency of the situation was palpable, and participants darted in every direction, frantically trying to secure alliances. The cacophony of voices and the din of hurried footsteps filled the air as the large speaker continued its instructions in various languages. The Colosseum had become a battleground even before the official fight began. “Let’s go” Steven spoke wearily, but with hope on hisof his side.
        
        Steven and Calista ran around, trying to form alliances. But the fact that they are both quite young and some people don’t speak English made it near impossible for them to successfully form one.
        
        Amid this chaotic frenzy, a girl bumps into Steven.
        
        “Sorry!” She said, turning around. 
        “No, it’s my bad,” Steven replied. Realizing that Steven speaks the same language, she stops and takes a better look at Steven. 
        “You looked about my age, and you speak English, right?” She questioned hurriedly.
        
        “Yeah I speak English,” he replies, trying to stay concentrated on her with all the pushing around.
        
        “We should team up then, I don’t want to get eliminated without even going into the actual battle,” she suggested, which Steven agreed almost immediately after Calista’s reassuring nod, since they didn’t know anyone and they couldn’t waste any more time.
        
        The timer sounded a “beep” as it hit 30. Beads of sweat were already appearing on his forehead.
        
        “The name’s Jeffrey. It might be a boy’s name but yeah my parents are weird. What’s your’s?” She shouted due to the increasingly loud noises.
        
        “Steven, and she’s Calista, the sister of a friend of mine. But right now, we need to find one more person!”
        
        He looked up desperately, to just see a sight that made him even more panicked. The timer was down to only 15 seconds, and 103 teams were already formed, the number was still going up.
        
        In the chaos, Steey hastily joined the trio, thereby forming a squad. Noticing the decrease in numbers, being able to speak the same language was essential. Thereby hearing their quick conversations, Steey approached them.
        
        “Let me join, my name’s Steey,” he spoke.
        
        As the seconds ticked away, the squad formed a hasty alliance, aware that time was of the essence. The rules allowed flexibility, such as the fact that team changing mid-way through the royale is legal, as long as only four people remain in the end, but with 700 participants vying for a spot in the first 125 teams, the struggle to secure a position intensified. The urgency of the situation forced them to make quick decisions, and together they rushed through the gates to confirm their registration as a squad. The clamour of the Colosseum echoed with the sounds of hurried footsteps, shouts, and the blaring instructions from the speakers. With a sense of unity amidst the chaos, the quartet ventured into a massive secured area. Large planes were stationed across the concrete, with many staff labelled people and participants walking around minding their businesses. 
        
        Steven felt a sense of relief despite that he knew very well that the real battle for survival hadn’t even begun yet. To their luck, their registration secured just in time as the intense battles for survival began in the pursuit of a coveted spot among the top four, or…
        
        The top squad. 
        
        Chapter 18- The Top Squad
        
        Steven was ready. He was more than ready. Ready couldn’t define how ready he was.
        
        “Let’s survive this,” Steven said. We just gotta become the top squad, right?
        
        Holding Calista’s little hand, he marched toward the darkness of the plane. Her heart was clearly trying to break her ribs.
        
        “Yeah, don’t let me down, guys! I will abandon you all if you’re dragging me down.” Jeffrey jokes.
        
        Steey just stayed silent as he marched along with them, his eyes invisible to the dim light that showed behind them. As they boarded the plane, they were each granted a set of parachutes.
        
        Calista looked at Steven confidently, trying to hide her inner nervous self. They are literary walking into death itself since the chances of winning feel as low as winning the lottery.
        
        Once others boarded the plane, the massive end slowly closed, leaving the light behind. The plane rushed down the runway in an instant, nearly making Steven trip from the sudden movement. They looked out their window toward the front. To their surprise, there was a massive concrete wall right in front of the plane. It’s like they were gonna crush right into the wall, leaving them with feelings of nervousness and anxiety. Steven turns his attention to the pilot in confusion. Doing so, he realizes that some other people are feeling this same sense of confusion. 
        
        However, the pilot seemed calm, it’s like he’d done this a dozen times before, which he might actually have.
        
        Soon their worries and confusion were lifted as the wall opened up like an automatic door to reveal the dense clouds covering the night sky. That’s just Steven’s assumption though, since they can’t really tell if it’s morning or night, since the clouds covered any source of evidence for either one. Among the clouds, a bit of light shone through, although it is uncertain if it was from the moon or the sun.
        
        As they were up in the air, Steven felt an ominous feeling; other groups had either become closer to each other like mates or had started planning out strategies and making use of the different strengths among the group. While his group just stayed surprisingly silent, none wanting to be the one to break the silence.
        
        However, Steven wasn’t one to run something without a plan, so when the apocalypse first broke out in Andle, he was stumped. The fact that he survived when many others couldn’t has always been a surprise. But this surprise drew out the inevitable fact that if it wasn’t for his friends that he followed throughout, there was no way he could’ve survived. That guilt that followed his survival from all his friends and loved ones that slipped away from his sight, never to be seen again.
        
        An announcement on the plane stopped various chatters, catching all their attention.
        
        “You all have 3 minutes to jump off the plane,” The announcement spoke in English, before speaking again in another language, then another one, and it carried on for a whole minute.
        
        After that, the back door of the plane opened, and a strong gust of wind consequently tried to suck them all out like a vacuum. Some who did not hold tight were pulled out in an instant.
        
        In both relief and curiosity, Steven turned to the side windows of the plane. Directly across their plane, Steven spotted another one, and another one behind that. After a second, he turned to see directly underneath them to find those who jumped down early from the opening of the door. While most deployed their parachutes successfully, there are some who Steven can see have clearly failed to do so.
        
        This gave a creep to Steven; what if one of their parachutes were outdated and did not work?
        
        “Dude chill! I ain’t dying here, at least not of this stupid competition.” Jeffrey reassures Steven upon realizing his anxiety.
        
        Steven realizes that his legs are shaking like crazy, hence he stops it immediately upon realization She’s right, there’s no point in panicking. The most I can do is try my very best and be the top squad.
        
        At one point, a relatively large city appeared over the horizon. Quite a few people got up and walked toward the end, waiting for the time when the plane was fully above the city.
        
        “I’m dropping here.” The three of them turned toward Steey in shock at him taking the initiative for the very first time. Steey took a glance at the dark-skinned person from before, his eyes reassuringly calm, hiding his inner demon.
        
        “You crazy! Literally, like a quarter of the people are landing here! Plus, what about the amount of zombies here?” She yelled.
        
        That’s when Steven realized something crucial.
        
        “The reason why this many people land there, in the city, is because it is guaranteed to have food, water, and shelter, the three necessary things required for survival. Whereas if we land somewhere else such as the plains or jungles, all of these necessities is a gamble,” Steven pauses and turns to Steey.
        “That’s why you chose here, right Steey?”
        
        “Yeah, I am landing here no matter what you guys say. You guys can come or go fend off for yourselves, I seriously don’t care.” Steey spoke of affirmatively, lying about his actual purpose.
        
        “Wow, that’s harsh man. So, I guess it’s decided. Get your chutes ready people, we dropping in ten seconds,” Jeffrey confirms.
        
        As time passed, they were already full speed ahead toward the ground. Steven has always thought that his first-time sky diving would be a thrilling and exciting experience, yet this one is filled with anxiety and insecurity. Once they reached a certain distance from the ground, Jeffrey and Steey deployed their chutes. In observation, Steven deployed too and to his luck, it didn’t malfunction and it deployed smoothly. 
        
        “Help!” A faint sound shouted on top of Steven. He looked up, just to see a gust of wind zoom past him. Unwanting to accept the possible miserable truth, he looked underneath him, just to find Calista who was still dropping at full speed.
        
        Calista is still dropping at full speed.
        
        “Come on, open!” Calista attempts, but the rope is jammed. Not Good…
        
        She was getting closer and closer to the ground, staring directly at death’s door.
        
        “Calista!” Steven shouted and looked as she was heading head first closer to the ground. “F###!” He shouted and threw away his parachute bag. His eyes gleamed a powerful blue, fitting the blue glowing in his shirt, and he zoomed at Calista, who was closing her eyes, ready to wake up in front of the great golden gates. “Gotcha!” Steven shouted and grabbed onto her tiny body. They were just inches from the ground.
        
        BOOM!
        
        A large cloud of dust blasted around the impact area, blinding the eyes nearby. Steey and Jeffery looked at the eye of the impact, their mouths stretched from disbelief. “S###!” Steey yelled and looked straight at Jeffery, “Just us”. However, contestants rushed away when they saw eyes, gem-blue eyes, staring at them through the dust. As the dust parted, there revealed two humans, one holding the other. No scratches, no bruises, not even a scar. Now those jaws were ripped off their heads, and Calista was as shaken up as they were. Steven was just staring at the trees like he was ready to them down until his eyes went back to brown-black. He turned back to see two teammates with a mouth big enough to fit a truck, “What?”
        
        “You need therapy,” Steey blankly said.
        
        “Holy moly!” she screamed ecstatically, her hands holding her head as her eyes looked at him widely and gasping between breaths, “How?!”
        
        “It’s this obsidian,” Steven pulls out the obsidian necklace that he was hiding with his shirt to show Jeffrey and Steey.
        
        “But like, I can’t control it, it just happens,” Steven stared at the stone, trying to solve this impossible puzzle.
        
        “Well these powers are worthless if you can’t control them,” Steey said coldly.
        
        Steven wanted to argue; thanks to him, a teammate of theirs is still alive. But he knows all too well that what Steey said is true. If he was able to control his powers, who knows how the past would’ve gone down? Who knows if he was able to control his powers, maybe his friends wouldn’t possibly be dead. Even better, maybe he would’ve been able to defeat the mastermind behind all this and save humanity. Due to his incapabilities, all he could do was wish for the best of this future filled with uncertainty. As powerful as something can be, as harmful it could be.
        
        Bang! Bang! Bang!
        
        Bullets whiffed beside their noses. It hasn’t even been a minute since they’ve landed and they’re already getting shot at.
        
        “Take cover!” Jeffrey shouted. They ran toward a building that was just meters away. It did not take Steey long to get there, his physique was completely different from what they had expected from his relatively short and small appearance. Steven and Jeffrey also got there without getting shot.
        
        That’s when Steven realized, where’s Calista?
        
        He quickly looked out to find Calista still taking fire, her back against a shattered bus. Her eyes showed traces of shock and panic, and her legs had no intention to move. She was frozen.
        
        “What should I do? If I go I might die. I might die if I go, but she dies if I don’t go, she dies…” Steven’s thoughts are all scrambled, unsure, and filled with anxiety about the future. Sweat beads rolled down his forehead, a promise is a promise.
        
        “Frick this.” Steven dashes out of cover in remembrance of his promise to Celestia. He knows very well from his friend's and family’s deaths that dying with pride and purpose is better than surviving with guilt and isolation.
        
        “Dude, what the hell” Jeffrey shouted in panic as she saw Steven DASH towards the bullet hell, “you’re gonna die you idiot!”. But Steven just kept running, as bullets danced past him.
        
        He somehow managed to not get killed in the process, just a few scratches here and there from the bullets. Once again, the other two couldn’t believe their eyes. How lucky can you get?
        
        “Calista, when there is an opportunity, we run together toward Steey and Jeffrey, okay?” Steven looked at Calista, desiring a promise. To his expectations, she just nodded, before they turned to look toward the rest of the group as bullets flew across them.
        
        The gunshots came to an end, and they made a desperate attempt to run. However, things don’t always go as planned. As they’re mid-way, the bullets start to fly again, but this time, the bullets are more accurate and loud. Steven turned his gaze over to where the bullets were coming from, and his hypothesis was correct; they had moved closer to their prey.
        
        Steey watched as Steven risked his life to save someone whom he just probably met not too long ago, who was not even related to him nor had been a friend that had been through a lot together. Steven said that he made some sort of promise to someone who saved him about a month ago. Bold, but stupid. But Steey just couldn’t understand why he would go as far as risking his life like this, even if it was a promise from his lifesaver. Just who the heck is he?
        
        As he continued to watch, he couldn’t help but ponder about his past, present, and future. Would I have done anything as bizarre as that? Not currently, and probably not in the future too. But at those times, when I have friends and family, would I? A heavy thought struck his head at this moment. He had done something like this in the past; the life-daring thing that he did when he saved Rose from the gangsters. Her red hair and puffy rosy cheek. Maybe that’s how she got her name. He remembered how everyday they would hold each other’s hand tightly while running to school together, how she would be beside him and comfort him when he felt down, how even during the long flight to China, she still glanced to see if he was okay. That’s right, she killed his parents. His teeth clenched, but it then loosened. 
        
        It wasn’t her fault, it’s all mine.
        
        He should have known they were coming for her, and he should have prepared. She was always there to help him, keep him safe from bullies, and maybe even the reason why his last school was heaven compared to the others. All he did was thrash at her and swear her gone. And then, she was gone. His eyes sharpened. He could see it in front of him. Rose in front, having her hand reaching out for him, waiting for him. He was gawking and reached out for her. Their hands inched closer, and then BAM! He watched as the events recoiled in front of him. A car slammed its front hard at her rear, and she fell, track tyres on her head. And finally, she disintegrated back to the ground. 
        
        A tear rolled down his cheek, a tear he couldn’t hold. Rose, was a close friend, whom some may call family. She was close. Blakay was a good friend but was nothing compared to her. He could hear the echo, getting louder and louder. His hands moved his face, and he was struggling to keep in the tears. He had a chance to apologize. But he just didn’t say sorry. His hands gripped his hair as he let out a few more tears. Why didn’t you say sorry?
        
        Why the frick didn’t you say sorry you jerk? 
        
        Maybe Emily was right, I am a curse.
        
        At that moment, the enemy had advanced too close to Steven for Steey to bear.
        
        “I’m going in,” Steey said and sprinted toward the side of the building as if he were trying to attack the gunners from the side in an attempt to distract the gunners, catching Jeffrey in total surprise. Steven realized this and tried to run faster, pushing Calista along.
        
        The gunners realized this threat and quickly changed their attention.
        
        “If we can just take one of them down, it’s our victory, especially that boy. That weird thing that went on tells me that he is going to be a hassle in the future if he stays in the game, you all got me!” The gunner commanded his team, which Steey could hear a bit from their close distance.
        
        The bullets burst towards Steey, and his eyes calculated every one of them within milliseconds. Quickly maneuvering his tiny body, he dashed from cover to cover, occasionally performing jumps left and right. The enemy could only watch, their eyes getting wider with every shot they took. 
        
        Once Steven and Calista set one foot into the building, Steey turned to run back. But his action caused the gunners to quickly realize it was all a distraction and turned their attention to Steven at the last moment, causing Steven to get shot in one hand.
        
        Argh.
        
        Despite this, Steven urged forward, until he was completely safe from fire. To their surprise, the gunshots were directed elsewhere immediately after that one shot that shot his arm, as they moved deeper into the darkness, sounds of screaming and disgusting consumption were heard.
        
        Jeffery found a dented flashlight at a corner. She shook it, making a shaking sound. There were still batteries. Flipping the switch, the light beam flickered a bit, before becoming full again. She shone the light at the corner, there was an abandoned shotgun, with lots of food and supplies around the area. But then, there was a creaking sound nearby. Her pupils shrank, and she swung the flashlight to point at wherever the sound took her, until she finally found a figure, and went across the stairs. “H-hello?” she quivered. Ding! Her flashlight pointed at the top, where there were more stairs and a bunch of elevators. “Steven? S-steey?” She shivered, hoping someone was by her side.
        
        “What is it?” Steey questioned, as they couldn’t see because of the wall the group moved toward Jeffrey. “Do you see it too?” Jeffrey asked, her hand kept shaking like crazy. Steevy looked at the stairs and elevators, and just shrugged. “What do I see?” he said, but then he saw a severed hand with zombie goo around it. He shakes his head back into shape. “What do I see?!” He shouted. “I saw someone head towards the elevator, do you think we should explore a bit?” Jeffrey asked, but Steevy shook his head. “No, they might be enemies, our best chances are to hide until other contestants kill each other,” he said. But even he was curious. 
        
        “Hey guys”, Steven just entered in, and Calista came in too. “We might be surrounded,” Steey said, batting his eyes around. “We just saw two figures nearby us. ”
        
        Calista felt Steven touching her from behind. She turned around in an attempt to look behind amidst the darkness of the room. However…
        
        It wasn’t Steven.
        
        …
        
        It started from a view filled with humid trees, and after that, it’s just a constant stream of white.
        
        It’s the same landscape no matter how far they walked still the same old cold and frozen peaks as they steadily hiked through the heavy snow.
        
        Finally, something different as usual appeared. Elijah pointed at the barely visible cloud of smoke gleaming above the horizon.
        
        They are low on food- 
        
        They are low on water-
        
        They are low on morale.
        
        It had been a week and a half, since they managed to leave the base. A three-stage plan was already in motion to find maybe even the slightest chance of survival. However, stage 1 of the mission was already proving to be outrageously difficult. They have climbed many hills, crossed many rivers, and fought lions with toothpicks, and yet, still no signs of civilization. Usually, Elijah would make a joke about how this would make grand stories for our children, but he’s already been crushed inside. In fact, nobody could lift a smile. Days felt like months as they kept searching and searching and searching, and they were just waiting for their breaking.
        
        “Hey, there’s a campfire up front. You all know what this means right??” 
        “Yeah, survivors,” Liam answered him, as the rest of the group caught on to their speed.
        
        “But we don’t know if they are hostile or not.” Luxury pointed out. Even so, it is definitely worth checking out. As they approached closer to the smoke, an area of pine trees emerged ahead, building up a frosty forest.
        
        They cut right through the forest, since going around it would take hours longer. It was only a short while before they started to see the light up ahead.
        
        “This way.” Elijah hovered toward the glimpse of light for the rest of the group to follow.
        
        But before Liam could answer, there was some rustling in the bushes. Norman drew out a small sharp glass knife from his pocket and pointed at the bush. “Who goes there?” he shouted, shaking his knife. But then he lowered it.
        
        A familiar face appeared in an unfamiliar appearance.
        
        A near-future tech suit-like cyborg.
        
        A person that’s supposed to be infected yet is pointing multiple guns, one for each and one of their heads.
        
        Elijah’s eyes popped out, he was supposed to be gone…
        
        “Afternoon, Elijah”, he croaked.
        
        Chapter 19- Hill, Heal, Hell, and Hail
        “N-Noah?” Luxury eyes twitched. He shouldn’t be alive… She remembered vividly that he was swamped, surrounded, and was never seen again after he closed the gateway to hell. He should be high up in the sky, not in the flesh and in front of them. 
        
        Maybe, he was a defect.
        
        Noah opened his mouth to speak, but someone behind him spoke first.
        
        “Hello people, we are just out here building a road.” The man hovered over to Noah signaling him to put the guns down.
        
        “ It’s always nice to find new survivors. Mark!” The guy shouted to a guy in the back. A skinny-looking guy with a suit and glasses walked quickly toward the man who greeted them. He was holding a book with both hands, and he nodded to the man. 
        
        A road? Norman’s eyes fixated on what was in front of them; A sign of concrete surrounded by the frosty hills.
        
        While Norman, Jules, and Chloe looked around the location, the rest of the group were still staring at Noah, their eyes having no way to budge. Despite the years that have passed, the overall aura that’s coming out of the cyborg felt similar, way too similar to be someone random. Being friends for so many years and having gone through so much, even if many years have passed, the recognition of someone is still inevitable.
        
        “Mark here will bring you to the general public. My name is Mr Kythagoras by the way, nice to meet you all. Well now, shall we carry on, Noah?” Mr Kythagoras grabbed Noah’s shoulder in one hand and walked away toward a group of people.
        
        “Right this way,” Mark waved the group to follow him, but Elijah wasn’t finished. “Hold it!” He shouted, keeping Mark to a sturdy halt. “You’re leaving us with a lot of unanswered questions here bucko” he stared at Mark, who had his back at him. “But first, what did you all do to Noah?” He slowly turned his head, giving him his side-eye with no emotions inside. “I’ll tell you on the way.”
        
        As they started to walk through the greyness amidst the white, Mark was looking grimmer than an emo. His eyes were covered by the shadows of his hair. “So?” Liam asked, his eyebrow rising. He knows the truth may not be at all pretty, his face tells the story.
        
        “You’ll see, it’s all part of God’s plan,” is all Mark would insist. It wasn’t long before they came across something that shook all their knowledge of the past.
        
        A gleaming city showed up ahead of them, surrounded by a massive wall of concrete. As they walked around, rivers of resource-filled trucks swiftly passed by. Their minds couldn’t believe it. The construction team was big enough to be a city itself. “Dude,” Liam’s mouth could fit a watermelon, “this city must be massive”, he said as they passed the gates of the city, which easily outshined the city of Tokyo. 
        
        As they exited through the light, the staggering populous city made its debut. They gazed in awe, a sense of wonder filling their senses. It has been ages since they have witnessed a city filled with life.
        
        “Hop on,” Mark entered a van, which the rest followed in. They drove around the city, and Mark pulled out a tablet.
        
        “So, what are you all good at? God doesn't make food grow itself,” Mark spoke sarcastically.
        “Me and Chloe here used to be in the military for our country, Jules here is good with computers and technology, as for the rest of them,” he eyeballed back at the 20-year-olds, “they can fight too I guess.”
        
        Mark looked over at the four younger ones and pulled off a laugh. He turned to look at Luxury, being the shortest one of the four.
        “You gonna fight, darling girl?” Mark laughed out loud and was joined by the driver himself. Red spread like wildfire on Luxury’s face, as she raised her fist and opened her mouth to give him a piece of her mind. But before she could, Charlotte held tightly onto her rising fist and gave her a worried look. Luxury’s fists began to soften. Her blood was boiling lava, but she had to resist her urge. Things could get worse.
        “I am not a kid, I’m 20,” Luxury spoke assertively. But none heard her.
        
        As they continued to take turns around the city streets, Elijah began to have second thoughts. Things were becoming gloomier with every inch they travelled, and their debut felt fake, and now empty. The car pulled over the side of a modern building, and they were instructed to hop off. The shock of all this made them lose their questions, as they just followed Mark.
        
        They were introduced to an apartment complex. It looked modern yet that modern felt dull. As they stood on the lift, Jules questioned Mark.
        
        “How did you guys produce electricity?” she asked him.
        
        “Wind energy, there are enormous wind gusts around this mountainous area.” 
        
        The lift reached a stop, and they were brought into their new home, unit 69.
        “I will leave you all to it,” Mark gestured the ring of 3 keys to them, which was greeted by Norman. Mark walked away, back to the elevator, and Norman opened the door with the twist of his keys.
        
        Inside was just like any modern apartment home. A kitchen, a living room, a dining area, and a toilet. Chloe walked toward the glass and pulled the curtains to reveal a skyline, just like any modern civilization. But this grasped her confusion; How did they manage to build all this in as little as five years? And most importantly, during an apocalypse like this? Pretty sure that Rome wasn’t built in a day. They took a seat in the living area filled with relatively old yet pretty couches and chairs, as they discussed the division of the rooms. Norman and Chloe claimed one room, Jules took another, and Charlotte and Luxury occupied the third. Elijah and Liam, the last pair, found solace in the final room.
        
        On the countertop, a tablet was left behind. Norman found it and had a quick read of it, his eyeballs kept getting narrower
        
        “We are all assigned to roles.” Norman started. He and Chloe, both with military experience, were assigned to join the military division. Jules, having expertise in computers, was sent to the management. Charlotte and Luxury were assigned tasks related to the operation of the city’s supermarkets and distribution centres. “Yeah of course they did”, Luxury huffed.
        
        Elijah and Liam were handed the physically demanding task of constructing the mysterious road towards the north, which probably fit 20-year-old men. Liam lay on the couch and took a slurp of water out of a plastic bottle, a kind of water that he had never had in years. Charlotte took out the plants from her bag and placed them on the dining table. They looked shrunken and weak, in no condition to fight.
        
        “Luxury, you wanna water them, or should I?” Charlotte asked her, but Luxury answered in disgust.
        
        “No way,” she said.
        “Come on, you used to like them,” Charlotte said, and the plants made puppy eyes.”
        “No,” she sighed assertively and took a seat on the single-seated couch.
        
        “Can’t we at least rest for today? I’m so tired from all that hike,” Liam argued, his breathing could be heard. However, the start date of labour was stated to be today, and the least they wanted was to offend the people who took them back into civilization itself. The anticipation of contributing to the city’s survival and meeting new people after so long tinged them with excitement as they joined the workforce, giving them at least a bit of motivation to get out there. Elijah stared above the horizon from the clear glass by the living room. Maybe it’s time to leave the past. Maybe it’s time to Heal and move on…
        
        On that initial day, as they worked diligently on the road construction, Elijah and Liam couldn’t help but notice the sombre and down-putting atmosphere among the other workers. Determined to make connections, they struck up a conversation with a fellow-labourer who worked beside them during a brief break.
        
        “Nice to meet you, the name’s Liam. So, what’s your story?” Liam asked, trying to break the ice. The manager came across to them, asking them to tick off their names. After Liam and Elijah ticked off theirs, Liam turned to peek at the fellow worker ticking off his name; he saw the worker’s name, Newton.
        
        “Newton?” Liam continued his question. 
        
        The workers, weary and downtrodden, shared glimpses of a reality that contradicted the excitement they felt. “It’s all the same, day in and day out. We work tirelessly, but the rewards are minimal. No breaks, no respite.”
        
        Liam exchanged puzzled glances with Elijah. They couldn’t understand the harsh testimony of their fellow worker, considering the initial sense of purpose they felt. 
        
        But their eyes shifted back to Newton. “Newton. What an interesting name! Like Isaac Newton?” Liam said, his efforts to make a good conversation were dwindling, “Are you smart too?” 
        
        Newton just hesitated a bit and shook his head. ”Cool, cool”, Liam said, trying to activate his buddy switch, “So … this apocalypse huh?”. He chuckled a bit, but as he glanced at Newton, his smile faded. Newton’s eyes looked more dead than dead. Seeing his efforts were futile, he just glanced back. “Sorry”. 
        
        “You don’t need to be sorry.”
        
        Liam’s hair jumped a bit. “Oh!” His gaze lightened up. “How so?” Newton finally looked at Liam, his expression only showed remorse. He took a deep breath. “Well, how do I even start?” His mind was taking him back.
        
        He explained how he used to be the captain of a rescue team beside the burj khalifa, and how he failed to keep control of the zombies. “Yep, I was that jerk  that let all this happen.” He was looking down, wiping his hand across his face, but felt a warm hand on his shoulder. “Hey, It's fine”, he said, “I don't think anyone could have held them back for so long, you were just doing your job.” He nodded, “Thanks” and carried on.
        
        He then told him how after he deserted his post, he explored and treated himself to a vacation of a lifetime, and then he ended up here. He looked at their working grounds, and a feeling of devastation surrounded him. “I was promised a place to live and hide from the apocalypse, but I ended up being lured to a prison. We work, we eat, we sleep, repeat. Only the bravest souls attempted to escape, only a few got away. Legends have it that they get imprisoned, or even worse, shot.” The bell rang, and Newton got to his feet, “So if you ever think of escaping, be ready to risk your life…” And with that, he’s gone. As the sun dipped below the horizon, confusion set in.
        
        “Shouldn’t we be heading home now?” Elijah asked, expecting a moment to rest and recharge.
        
        Newton with a hint of bitterness in his voice, shattered their expectations.
        “Here, the work never stops. We carry on through the night. Breaks are a luxury we can’t afford.”
        
        Elijah and Liam exchanged glances, the excitement of the first day morphing into confusion and concern. The realization that their labour came without respite and the stark contrast between their expectations and the harsh reality left them questioning the true nature of the city’s promises. Their eyes only grew, once they knew.
        
        We really are trapped in a prison
        
        By the time it reached about midnight, they were finally allowed to leave. As the two set foot inside the apartment, Charlotte tossed them an apple each.
        
        “That’s your dinner,” she yawned, before heading into her room. The living area was empty and the whole house was quiet as heck, except for the snoring of some people.
        
        In the morning, they were all awakened by a loudspeaker bloom, marking the start of their work routine again.
        
        Days turned into weeks, and the routine became an unrelenting grind. Elijah and Liam, accustomed to physical labour, found themselves pushing their limits as the road construction continued without pause. They would gladly take Luxury and Charlotte’s jobs. Norman and Chloe, in their military role, patroled and had regular drills regularly. Despite that they are physically strong, they begin to face limits too. Eventually, everyone would come back, their minds lusting for that warm pillow and comfy bed, just for that goddamn loudspeaker to yell at them and get them going. This doesn’t feel like training anymore, it felt like hell.
        
        Norman tried to apply for leave, for reasons from sickness to personal problems. But no matter how hard he tried to come up with a solution, his papers would come back with a big red X.
        
        No human could bear this anymore.
        
        Amidst the exhaustion and frustration, Elijah and Liam approached Jules one night, who was now navigating the complexities of city management. “Can you find out about our friend Noah?” Elijah asked. “And maybe find out about what this city is all about and start answering our questions, you know, is it really worth it living in here, and what is all that crap around this city and its labour.”
        
        Late one night, as exhaustion gripped them, Jules cautiously shared her findings. “I connected with Noah. Damn was he different from before. Anyway, he hinted at something more, something the city is hiding. But we need to be cautious; we’re walking a dangerous line.”
        
        Before they could strategize their next move, a knock echoed through the door. Suspicion hung in the air as they cautiously opened it to find an enigmatic figure, face shrouded in darkness, delivering a coded message.
        
        “Keep your inquiries silent. Dissent disrupts the order that keeps the city alive,” the messenger warned before melting into the shadows.
        
        Determined to unravel the mystery, they discreetly approached their fellow workers during breaks, questioning them about the road’s ultimate destination. However, the responses were always the same - blank stars and ignorance. None of the workers seemed to know the true purpose behind ceaseless construction.
        
        Jules on the other hand, found out information, such as the population of about 8 thousand, and the location of the city. Elijah and Liam are doing their best, I have to try my best too. She turned on her computer and logged in. 
        
        “Jules, can you book the meeting room for 4?” Her manager asked her.
        “Yup,” she replied and opened the room blog. “Sorry sir but it was booked for the executives.”
        
        “All goods Jules.” The manager told her and carried on with his business. An executive meeting… A great potential source She decided to secretly attend a director’s meeting, hoping to eavesdrop and uncover the true purpose of the road. 
        
        Dressed inconspicuously, Jules slipped into a corridor by the room unnoticed. She positioned herself behind the partially closed door leading to the meeting room, hoping to catch snippets of the conversation within. As the directors discussed various topics, her anticipation heightened.
        
        Suddenly, the atmosphere in the room shifted, and the words she overheard shivers down her spine. 
        
        The city’s leaders were plotting an invasion of another city underneath China? 
        
        The shock of this revelation left Jules paralyzed with disbelief. The road they were constructing was not just a path; it was a sinister means to carry out a hidden agenda.
        “What do you think you’re doing here lady?” the security guard demanded, suspicion written across his face. His voice spiked through Jules’s soul.
        
        Caught off guard, Jules stammered, “I… I got lost. I was just looking for the restroom.”
        
        The security guard’s expression remained cold. “Move away and get back to work. We don’t tolerate eavesdropping on important conversations.”
        
        Jules feigned compliance and retreated from the corridor. However, her actions didn’t go unnoticed. The security guard was no fool, and what he saw was fishy to the next level. Jules might have overheard something crucial.
        
        “Mr Kythagoras, someone might’ve overheard something crucial,” he begins his call, detailing the unexpected intrusion and expressing concern about the potential breach of their plans. “What should I do boss?”
        
        Upon receiving the call, Mr Kythagoras instructed, “Keep an eye on her for now. Report any unusual behaviour or conversations. We can’t afford any leaks.”
        
        …
        
        “WTF!” Chloe spurted out her drink. 
        “Are you sure?” Norman questioned her, but she nodded assertively.
        “We gotta do something,” Elijah put down his foot.
        
        That night, they decided to venture beyond the confines of their assigned area. Under the cover of darkness, they sneaked out, navigating the empty streets with cautious steps. As they approached the massive wall that enclosed the city, they stumbled upon a scene that would shatter their understanding of the sanctuary they called home.
        
        A lone figure was attempting to scale the towering wall, desperation evident in every furtive movement. They concealed themselves in the shadows, observing the unfolding drama. The figure, struggling to escape, finally reached the top of the wall, only to be met by a stern voice.
        
        “What a shame. Attempting to escape is futile,” declared Mr Kythagoras.
        
        The person attempting to escape, panting and terrified, begged for mercy. The dialogue between Mr Kythagoras and the escapee echoed through the night, revealing the shocking secrets that lay underneath the surface of the seemingly utopian city.
        
        “The consequences of attempting to leave are severe,” Mr Kythagoras continued with his monologue.
        “Those who try to do so, are executed.”
        
        They exchanged horrified glances, their discovery of this dark reality overshadowing the initial sense of wonder they had when they first entered the city. As the gravity of the situation sank in, Mr Kythagoras continued with an even more chilling revelation in the realization that the man continued to try and run. 
        
        “You see, there’s no point in running, I had every resident of this city planted with a death device within them. It ensures loyalty and obedience.”
        
        “F##k this sh##” the man ran for his life. Mark passed a device to Mr Kythagoras. The next thing they knew, the man was blown into bits.
        
        The weight of revelation hung heavily in the air as they grappled with the enormity of what they had learned. Before they could process it fully, their cover was blown.
        
        Noah, seemingly appearing out of nowhere, confronted them with a stern expression. “You all shouldn’t be here. It’s dangerous to delve too deeply into matters that don’t concern you.”
        
        Besides Noah, the security guard who caught Jules appeared.
        
        Mr Kythagoras, catching wind of the intruders, approached with a cold gaze. “Look who we have here. Execute them. We cannot allow them to jeopardize our order.”
        
        “Umm, sir?” Mark said, his voice waving with uncertainty, “We forgot to plant bombs into them.” Mr Kythagorus didn’t give him a response. “Well then, Noah” he nodded, “You know what to do.”
        
        Noah’s arm then transformed into a gun, pointing at the huddling group.
        
        “Wait, N-Noah!” Liam pleaded, his hands up high as the gun made contact with his cheek. “It's us, your friends.” His face didn’t move a muscle
        
        “Come on Noah, remember?” Liam’s shivering voice lowered to a soft tone, “We played eggball together. We were there together when we needed it.” Liam’s hands gently fell onto the gun, “We survived together…”
        
        Noah, hesitating for a moment, lowered his gun, and countered,” They might be useful sir.”
        
        Mr Kythagoras eyeballed Noah, suspecting that he was saving them, but he trusted him. “Alright, Mark, take them away.” Mr Kythagoras ordered Mark with a serious look. “You know what to do.”
        
        After Noah cuffed them up, Mark, who was standing silently by Mr Kythagoras, led them all away from the scene. The secrets they had stumbled upon had plunged them into the darkest corners of the city's reality. The road they were building now seemed like a path to a place far more ominous than they could’ve ever imagined.
        
        A shady dark grey building appeared in front. Luxury gulped, but the commander had already found this suspicious. “Excuse me, but what is this building for?” Chloe asked, but her question was ignored. 
        
        Noah walked beside them, Mark turned to them, and back to Noah.
        
        “You see, Noah told us all about you idiots.” He began.
        
        “It was on that mission you see, we were invited to go to UAE to make a deal.”
        
        “We eventually made it there, close to the evil overlord of this apocalypse. But then, we found this kid, lying at the front door, half dead. It was like god’s will you know, Mr Kythagoras decided to take him in.” The lighting of the tower was getting denser every minute.
        
        “We brought him back to base. With bits on his arms, legs, and chest, most of his body functions were being infected, so we cut it off, there’s nothing we can do. But with his big brain, he modified himself with robotic arms, which operate similarly enough to his own.” He said a grim smile took place on his face as they got to the top of the stairs. 
        
        He snorted, “I think I should introduce myself again,” he said and headed to the back of the group, where Noah was standing. When Liam looked at Noah’s eyes, his eyes shook in fear. They were there, but his essence wasn’t. “N-Noah?” He asked, looking hard at his eyes for any sense of it. No response. “I am Mark, secretary of the great Mr Kythagoras,” Marks explained. “And we work hand in hand with Master Amad” The group felt an electric jolt pass through them, memories of the devil gripped through their veins. “And your friend here”, Noah’s eyes turned red and he kept hold of his sturdy frown as he raised a small blue cannon. 
        
        “He works for us now.”
        
        BLAM!
        
        The group felt a large force that sent them to the other side of the room. They toppled over each other as a massive metallic door slammed between Luxury’s outreaching hand and Noah’s feet. “Enjoy your stay” Mark’s voice penetrated the door, and they heard the footsteps get quieter and quieter until it was gone. 
        
        “Sh##!” Elijah shouted as he sent himself to the door, making not even a dent. 
        
        Luxury clenched her fists, she had started to have enough of all this mess. Charlotte sat back, and sounds of shattering started to be heard from the outside.
        
        As the group looked out of the rough grey prison window, it began to hail.
        
        …
        
        It began hailing, a weather that Steven had not seen for years.
        
        “Come on Steven, let’s survive,” Steey signaled.
        
        Chapter 20- Echoes of Steven’s Might
        
        “Hurry! To the top!” Jefferey suggested. They exchanged nods and began in an attempt to reach the top floor.
        
        “On the way, we will check through each flour for supplies, alright?” Steey said as he led the way. At first, Steey looked like the kind of person without a plan; Just rushing the zombies as if he had some grudge against them. However as time went on, it became clear as day that he was not gonna fall, at least not so easily.
        
        “Go!” Steey held the door toward the stairway as the others ran past him. The empty stairway echoed their heavy footsteps. Climp-Clomp, Climp-Climp.
        
        Steey thrust the door shut with his incredible might and followed them up the never-ending echo.
        
        Steven slammed open the door leading to an office space, revealing more and more zombies each time. Thankfully, the electricity is out, so the doors of each floor are unlocked. In a swift attempt, he cracked open the counter drawers and pushed all the goods into the bag.
        
        Steey sprinted and caught up to Calista, who was doing quite badly already. Her bag was empty, her breath heavy, as she kept trying to keep up with the other two. 
        
        “Calista, pass me another bag!” Jeffrey shouted across the hallway, catching the zombies' attention. 
        “Yup,” she sprinted toward Jeffrey.
        
        As Steey grabbed the drinks from a mini fridge, an unpleasant feeling stumbled across his mind. She might be a hassle.
        
        “All clear!” Steven yelled as he kicked a couple of zombies into a room before locking the door. He yeeted open the door leading to the stairwell.
        
        “Quickly you two!” Steey grabbed the stairway door and urged Steven to continue upwards. Steven hesitated for a moment before Steey whispered carefully to him.
        
        “It would be good if you could get a couple of floors ahead of us, at Calista’s rate, we will either not make it to the top, or we will make it to the top, but will have to get back down here for supplies in no time.” Steey took a sneak peek at his scar from the bullet earlier. It was healing surprisingly fast, but he still hadn’t recovered to the stage where he would be able to outperform Steven.
        
        He nodded in trust to Steey and continued upwards without them.
        
        The two eventually rushed through the door, unconsciously leading a dozen of bloodlusters. Once the two were through, Steey punched the door shut. Initially, Calista demonstrated a confused look on her face, as she looked around in expectancy of seeing Steven. Knowing what she might be thinking, Steey pointed up and began running. And so, they followed.
        
        “I’ve done that floor, do the one above it,” Steven shouted from above the staircase. Steey gave a thumbs-up before leading them to another floor.
        They continued to splay up the staircase, stopping at each floor and filling up their newly obtained bags from the first floor. 
        
        …
        
        “Let’s take a break,” Steey eventually said after he formed up with Steven. They were all sweating, but Calista felt like she was about to puke. As Steven looked out of the broken glass, his height surprised him. It felt like they were running forever, yet the height of the other buildings told him otherwise- They were only halfway.
        
        “Why don’t Calista go to the top and wait for us, she was slowing us down,” Jeffrey protested. It sounded quite harsh, but Steven knew it was true, so he stayed silent.
        
        “Yeah, why don’t you just wait for us up there,” Steey supported Jeffrey. And so, they passed Calista the filled bags for her to carry two by two to the top.
        
        “Let’s all split up then, it would make it a lot faster,” Steven suggested.
        
        “Yeah,” Jeffrey pulls her bag tight, and slugs it on her back. “these grummlens are just annoying now.,”. The door banged louder and louder as every moment passed, so as soon as they had enough rest, they began their operation.
        
        …
        
        “One more!” Steey shouted, with Jeffrey and Steven finishing their floors. He scrambled up the creaking stairs, his heart beating faster and faster with every step. Outside, the chilling darkness enveloped the world. This time, it was broken by the sporadic glows of the distant fires and the eerie luminescence of the moon. The moonlight casts a gleam of light amidst the darkness, creating an otherworldly glow upon the decaying landscape, creating an unsettling contrast to the darkness that lurked underneath.
        
        As Steey forcefully slammed open the final door with a piece of broken wood, it revealed an unexpected sight- an auditorium bathed in a still silence that echoed his very footsteps. The air seemed to thicken with an unspoken jinx, and a shiver crawled up Steey’s spine as he cautiously set foot into the surprisingly quiet room. Instinctively, he felt a sense of uncertainty about the tranquillity that contradicted the apocalyptic chaos outside.
        
        Just as Steey was about to turn around because of the lack of resources in his sight, a sudden crash shattered the silence that once was behold in the dark and cold room. As traces of bloodshed appeared on the carpet, Steey knew very well what was going to happen. Panicking, Steey sprinted to the stage, only to find more of the undead emerging from the torn curtains. Surrounded and cornered, the once peaceful auditorium turned into a nightmare demon. Every step deeper into the abyss seemed like a foolish dance with death itself, as Steey faced the grim reality that the undead had turned the auditorium into an uncomfortable stage for their feast.
        
        I’ve done it before, and I will do it again.
        
        He dashed towards the exit with only one motive in mind- get out of there and shut the door tight. He leapt upwards, using the enemy as his stairs, but things don’t always go as planned.
        
        To his surprise, one caught his leg, before another, and another on his shoulders, and another on his head.
        
        He spun around, kicking the zombies away, all that was in contact with him was now just ripped pieces of arms. He made his war cry and threw a fist right through one of the zombies. Except, it didn’t go through. The zombie got pushed back a little, but it didn’t tear the flesh apart. He threw a few more punches, but the zombie wall wasn’t breaking. It felt like his fists were only equipped with pushback but no damage. 
        
        Realising his vulnerable back, he made a quick turn to kick away a zombie after making sure that his front was safe for a couple of seconds as he held back the gang behind him. But he didn’t know, that the zombies are physically stronger at night. As the zombie moved faster than before, with his eyes filled with nothing, but the darkness of bloodshed.
        
        In the nick of time, Steven arrived, delivering a powerful headbutt to the nearest zombie and saving Steey from the approaching danger. Now that the zombies noticed Steven, they were both entrapped. It’s like one sacrifice is not enough.
        
        But Steven knows that he won’t die, it’s not that he knows the future, it’s that he couldn’t die so early, at least not yet, until he reveals the truth about the cursed and crushed reality itself. He is the main character after all.
        
        However, Steven’s combined efforts with Steey seemed futile, the zombies, stronger than ever, are still cornering them. This is no use. I gotta try. I gotta use the power. I gotta use it. I must use it.
        
        As he dived deep in thought, his actions seemed to slow down, and the zombies got closer to him than ever. “Please, please, please,” he pleaded as he tried to recall the emotions that led to this unleash before. The obsidian around his neck began to gleam fiercely as he attempted to summon the unfathomable force. 
        
        “Come on!” Steven clenched his right fist and aimed toward the exit. In an instant, he unleashed his punch, the energy erupting like a controlled explosion. As a surge of strength propelled the punch forward, its extreme power of it sent shockwaves through the zombies, eradicating them from their very existence. The impact echoed with the intensity of a thousand explosions, obliterating not just the zombies but also the very walls that separated the auditorium and the stairway. The sheer audacity of the blow created a shockwave that rippled through the surroundings, distorting reality as if the laws of nature themselves were irrelevant to the strength of the punch. Walls crumbled down along with the gust of dust that flew out the cracked window toward the outside. A strong swift of wind followed, nearly blowing Steey out of his stance. All that was left was the echoes of Steven’s might.
        
        “Come on!” Jeffrey shouted across, as she sprinted up to meet with Calista at the final floor. Putting aside the questions for later, the two sprinted together back to the stairway and up, towards the final floor. Steey rushed in and quickly decelerated to a stop, his breath heavier than a madman. As Steven attempted to pull the door shut, a thing caught onto his leg. Something sharp, something white, something horrible.
        
        He kicked the zombie away and slammed the door, leaving only peace, with the rest of his squad staring at his god-awful leg.
        
        They stayed in silence, with Jeffrey moving further and further away from Steven. He bent down and looked at his bloody leg, he took a step back to the door.
        
        “I will leave.”
        
        “No,” Calista said assertively, her face straight and emotionless.
        
        “Your stone can save you, can’t it?” Steey questioned after witnessing its explosive strength. Steven explained that it wouldn’t work on his experience of Xander, who died despite having the obsidian due to the bite. 
        
        “If you turn, can’t Steey just kick you out then?” Calista tried to argue, and Steey adjusted to her response.
        “Yeah, stay. You never know what miracles will happen. And I am strong enough to kill you, you know me, right?”
        “Please Steven,” Calista pleaded. Upon witnessing Steey’s strong yet cold capabilities and personality, Steven decides to trust him.
        
        They shoved cabinets and tables onto the door to stop it from breaking over the loud zombie bangs. Their bags were all filled with goods now, and they began organising the food. Suddenly, a spark of brightness was highlighted on their wrists, where the device had shot into their flesh before. A number was portrayed; 500. Soon, the number began decreasing, decreasing faster, and faster. Eventually, it decelerated, landing on a number that said “394”.
        
        “A lot of people died today, this might sound bad but, It’s a good thing for us, right?” Steey declared.
        
        “Yeah, I guess in no time, we will be getting out of here,” Steven cheered before Calista replied with a simple down putting “No”.
        
        “It doesn’t take as quickly as you think, Steven,” Steey’s tone tuned down.
        
        “How long does it usually take then? A week?” Steven started to get anxious, as he bandaged his bite.
        
        “A couple of months. Three weeks at the very quickest,” Calista said, which Steven thought she was trolling him, but then Steey’s strict and emotionless voice displaced Steven’s misunderstanding.
        
        “She’s right, and the longest I’ve seen on TV while I am in hiding is three months, which is when the government decided that it took too long and rescued everyone, even though no one got the “favour”,” Steey emphasised.
        
        Over the broken glass, a weird robot machine appeared which caught Steven off guard. Steven got up in confusion, but Calista and Steven, both having already witnessed the battle royales in the past calmed him to sit back down and enjoy their dinner. 
        
        “Thank goodness,” Celestia sighed in relief as she saw them alive and unharmed. Through the lenses of the camera, Celestia could see her sister and Steven all in one piece through her old TV. Amid the turmoil, she managed a smile, a small tear glistening in the corner of her eye.
        
        The robot flew to Calista and dropped her a small black box before it flew away.
        
        “You got sponsored I see,” Steey exclaimed, knowing that this would be an advantage. As she lifted open the flap of the box, a note along with a pistol was revealed. 
        
        “It’s from one of my relatives, the one from the antique store you remember, Steven? The one that you and my sister went to where there is an old man,” Calista tries to recall Steven’s memory because of his confused look, but that wasn't what he was confused about.
        
        She unfolds the note, which reads, “May the obsidian guide you in your favour..”
        
        “So, what is this “Sponsor”?” Jeffrey questioned, and Steven nodded and stared at the two, waiting for their explanations.
        
        Luckily, Calista was an expert.
        
        “So basically, we have show businesses.” Calista started, “They want to give the audience what they want, so they allow the audience to bet on who is going to win.” She folds the note before shoving it in her pocket, “So to rig it a bit, they give us these “benefits” depending on the amount of money that people bet on us. Things that could heal us”, she picks up the pistol with red eyes, “or clean the competition.”
        
        “Sponsors can also affect the speed of delivery and how good it is” Steey added on, not god happy about the machine gun. “The more money, the faster they arrive, the better they are. That’s how that group of people got guns as early as when we initially landed.” He faced away from the group, “We obviously weren’t their top pick.”
        
        They decided to take turns patrolling by the door, just in case anyone attempted to reach this floor or if the zombies broke through the fortified door. And they decided the order through a classic game of rock paper scissors, you know, why not?
        
        Steey goes first, then Steven, then Jeffrey, before finally to Calista right before the morning.
        
        And so, Steven closed his eyelids, asleep in this poor environment.
        
        …
        
        “Hey, wake up,” Steey attempts to wake up Steven. Steey grabbed out an old mechanical watch that he found while they were scrambling each floor for food. 
        
        “It’s eleven already, it’s your time to patrol,” Steey continues after noticing Steven’s barely opened eye. 
        
        “My bad,” he dusted off the little dust that flew onto his jacket and stood up, before walking slowly to the chair that faced the barricades. Just as Steven was about to take a seat, Steey grabbed his arm.
        
        “By the way,” he started, “why are you so selfless?”
        
        “I am not selfless, I am just doing my best to protect myself and the people around me. I don’t want anyone else to sacrifice themselves” Steven declared with an echo of sadness hidden underneath the smile on his face, his eyes reflecting a mix of determination and weariness. Steey immediately understood without much explanation; he survived when his loved ones died. He knows that this bizarre feeling isn’t as comforting as you would think.
        
        “Oh, you never talked about yourself, how are you this strong?” Steven questioned.
        
        “I prefer not to talk about the past,” Steey rejected, the losses of his parents,  and his first-ever friend Rose, and Blakay, and all the other friends were just too much to be spoken in words. He expected Steven to continue pursuing answers, just like Blakay did. But instead, he just carried on after noticing the negative image portrayed on Steey’s face.
        
        “If you don’t want to mention it, there’s no point in me continuing to ask then. Instead, can you teach me how to properly fight?” Steven pleaded, which caught Steey completely off guard. Despite that Steven had fought off and survived against the zombies alone when they were searching, Steey could tell that he was an amateur by his slow and uncoordinated moves. Even if they are weak, most people wouldn’t admit their weakness. Yet here is Steven, asking for help amidst this battle.
        
        Steey couldn’t reject it, the way he asked was definitely boiling his pride inside, so how could he turn him down?
        
        “Fight me,” Steey said and walked off to a closed storage-looking room. 
        “Wha-What?” Steven protested in confusion, he turned around to make sure that the rest of them were asleep and the door was barricaded tightly, before he turned back to follow Steey like his pet.
        
        Once Steven was inside, Steey threw a punch at Steven, knocking him back to crash onto an already broken desk.
        
        “AHH!” Steven yelled silently in pain, trying not to wake up the others. He looked over at Steey like some crazy maniac, while he was in a fighting position, flicking his finger like an invite to fight back. Steven clenched his fist and sprinted toward Steey at full force, only to be dodged and knocked his fist onto the wall. Steven looked at his bleeding fist, his face getting redder like a tomato.
        
        “Too slow you noob! Come on dingus,” he said, trying to get Steven riled up, but he didn’t see anything light up in Steven’s eyes. Seeing his efforts were no good, he sighed, loosened his muscles and opened the door, “That’s enough for today, good night.”
        
        “Not Yet!” Steven slams the door shut, nearly awakening Jeffrey and Calista in the process. His eyes ignited a fire. He unleashed a powerful blow on Steey, his hands were like fire. But Steey was on another level, he quickly dodged the unexpected blow, his hair millimetres away from the echoes of the punch, before spinning to deliver a powerful kick onto Steven’s face.
        
        As Steven landed on both feet, his expression stayed unchanged, “Not enough” Steey said as he stared at the glowing obsidian like a complete psycho. 
        
        …
        
        “And that’s the last of our food,” Jeffrey sighed. As Calista kept track, 2 weeks had passed, and only 44 people were left in the royale. They are now one of the top 10% of survivors, winning this doesn’t feel like a dream anymore, it feels like something accomplishable. With their hopes up, they slowly removed the barricades that they’d set up and exited the building filled with the undead in the search for a new source of goods.
        
        Creak
        Creak
        Creak—
        
        The door creaked open, and they swiftly exited the building, dashing down the stairs. The sunlight pierced through the undemanding clouds, shining through the darkness of the stairway. The pursuit of zombies was confined to only the floor where Steven blasted the wall in an attempt to save Steey. The doors of the remaining floors remained sealed, proving a brief respite for the fleeing group. In no time, they were out of there, ready to seek new refuge and find supplies.
        
        “All clear?” They peeked out a corner, ensuring that the coast was clear. Steven’s eyes swung left and right, no one was in sight.
        
        “Go go go!” T Steven declared as they sprinted to find a vehicle. 
        
        BANG!
        
        Steven’s ears caught the echoes of a sniper’s shot and quickly moved his back into a bridge-shaped arc, letting the bullet whistle past him. 
        
        “Shoot! I missed!” the sniper yelled to his teammates. The snipers jumped from the roof of buildings to buildings, slowly closing in on them from all of their front. 
        
        “Shoot! We’re surrounded”, Jeffery said once the chorus of bullets began. They all crouched down and went for cover behind the vehicle as more shots were fired. As they ran for cover, Steey looked out above the horizon to see it on top of a building yards away.
        
        And then, sounds of motorbikes are heard behind them, a whole group of people on motorbikes headed towards where the sniper shots were heard, pushing the snipers to stand their ground and stop pursuing them. The motorbike gang had 12 people, which made Steven’s eyes twitch. They hovered over to the side of the vehicles as the bikes went past them, with the vehicles as cover to the sniper group and the motor gang. They hopped off their bikes and started to fire their assault rifles against the snipers.
        
        “They’ve made an alliance I see,” Steey whispered to Steven.
        
        From a distance, a group of running footsteps were heard, a squad, it sounds like.
        
        Despite their numbers, the gang of 12 is losing ground and people. 7 left, Steey counted in his head. The leader seems to be getting desperate, before deciding to start retreating. He made a handheld signal before they started slowly falling back, slowly heading toward the right of Steven and Steven’s squad.
        
        At this rate, they would get clapped in the middle like a sandwich, and the next thing they knew, there wouldn't be a thing, just an ash of nothingness. 
        
        Chapter 21- Helplessness Ain’t Desperation
        
        The snipers are advancing, leaping from building to building, each four of them scattered in front of them. By their impressive mobility, coordination, and accuracy from that impressive distance, they were no amateur.
        
        From their side, the motor gang is slowly getting closer to them. It was like they were teasing them.
        
        From behind Steven, the group is slowly approaching, and the sound of their rifles gets louder as every moment passes. Steey can hear the sound of his heartbeat getting loudly unbearable. From a distance, the footsteps were getting louder and louder. Steven could see the uneasy faces of the rest of them, as they got rather uncomfortable feeling the sound of death closely approaching. While they are approaching, the motor gang is still getting closer, closer, and closer.
        
        It felt helpless.
        
        But Steven was desperate.
        
        He is desperate to keep his promises to Celestia, his parents, and his friends, who entrusted him with the necklace thereby providing him with the chance to save humanity with the cure. He set his eyes on the motorbikes that the gang rode, the engine burning hot, ready to move whenever.
        
        “Guys, what will we do!!! At this rate we are pancakes!’ Jeffrey silently whispered in anxiety, her voice shaky. 
        
        “That,” Steven said, pointing at the motorbikes.
        Jeffrey looked at Steven with wide eyes, does man really think he’s from Mission Impossible?
        
        Well, they eventually really made a run for it.
        
        They sprinted using the gun’s fire as cover for their footsteps. Steven hopped onto one of the bikes with Calista following closely behind him. Steey tried to get on a larger bike, before realising his legs didn’t reach the bottom of the bike. 
        
        “Here!” Jeffrey shouted, hovering Steey to hop onto hers. However, her voice turned the motor gang member's attention to their squad. Oh, Crap.
        
        “Hey!” A woman yelled, turning around to point her rifle at Jeffrey. This caught the rest of the motor gang’s attention, their faces were looking like they were ready for a kill once they saw teenagers onboard their bikes..
        
        “Go go go!” Steey yelled for Jeffrey to move. As his breath got heavier and the group had their fingers on their triggers, Steven quickly twisted the accelerator, nearly ramming into one of the motor gang people on accident, before taking control of it and turning back to follow behind Jeffrey. The woman pulled the trigger, firing one single shot through the air before she fell flat onto the floor with an unreal hole piercing through her heart.
        
        “Watch our backs! We will get those punks later,” The leader said after taking cover, as they turned their attention back to the snipers. Calista turned to make sure that they weren’t getting pursued, just to notice a guy from the motor gang looking straight into her eyes with a middle finger aimed at her. 
        
        The snipers sniped a few shots at them too, but with their speed, the snipers missed every single shot before Steven and the others were no longer in their sight. After a while, they reached the mall entrance in the corner of the city, where they hopped off and decided to base. 
        
        “It’s in the corner of this megalopolis, so I doubt it’s been looted,” Steven suggested. Calista’s hair looked like she just got shot by a lightning bolt, “Jeez, you sure are good with bikes.” she murmured. Instead of a reply, Steven just shrugged, with a smile drawn across his face over that unpredicted success.
        
        …
        
        
        They rushed through the mall, scrambling for supplies. As Steven ran up an elevator, he saw a toy store, its windowsill featuring a limited edition Nerf Gun. Memories flooded his mind, this idea of going against bloodthirsty zombies with nothing more than a gun toy, was first present when E-man brought one with him. The Warehouse, where they armed themselves with larger and stronger variants of it. He chose a shotgun, he remembered. And the joy of fighting zombies with nothing more than a boy’s favourite toy. Who would’ve thought about it? It’s like a dream come true for kids who like guns and guns who deal no damage. But then, the darkness flooded his mind. His friends who got bitten, his friends who got turned, and his friends who faced death. That’s when he thought about Calista. That’s when he thought about his squad and how they nearly all turned into those mindless beings if it wasn’t for his sudden surge of power during nighttime. 
        
        Guns. Toy guns.
        
        He quickly grabbed a trolley, with a slight dent on the left side, and speedruns the store, getting four Nerf assault rifles, a couple packs of bullets, extra mags, and batteries. In an hour, they all met in the middle of the mall after looting through their assigned locations.
        
        Jeffrey approached the meagre stash of goods they had managed to pile up together. “Let’s see what Lady Luck has granted us,” she muttered, her voice waiting for something, anything that would get them outta this desperate situation.
        
        Steey peered beside Jeffrey's shoulder, his expression grim as he surveyed the small pile. “Doesn’t look like much,” he sighed.
        
        “Better than nothing, right?” Steven tries to cheer up the rest of the group, but no one could smile..
        
        “Figures. Been two weeks since it all started. Probably looted everything worth taking.” Steey tried to find reason, his tone resigned. With careful hands, they began the delicate task of dividing the goods, but it didn’t take them more than a minute.
        
        Jeffrey nodded, her eyes scanning the dwindling supplies. “We’ll have to make it work.”
        
        “It’s not gonna last long,” Steey remarked, his voice heavy with concern as they finished portioning out the rations. “Maybe a day, if we’re lucky.”
        
        As Steey began putting the supplies back on the trolleys, Jeffrey realised Steven’s trolley was filled with Nerf guns. Steven notices her glare and realises something.
        
        “Oh I nearly forgot, take one each,” Steven hands out the rifles, catching the rest of the group in total surprise.
        
        “What is this for?” Jeffrey observed the gun from left to right. Before Steven could open his jaw, a loud rumbling noise caught their attention. Calista took a few steps to look over the corner at where the sound was coming from. 
        
        “What is it?” Steven asked, slowly jogging towards her back. As Steven looked out of the corner, he froze for a second in shock. He turned to face Calista, who turned to face him too in an expressionless state. 
        
        He quickly grabbed the frozen Calista’s hand and ran back toward Steey and Jeffrey. Steven skimmed through the rest of the squad’s panicked faces and grabbed the toy rifle from the trolley. 
        
        “What!!!” Jeffrey yelled in confusion and anxiety before she noticed the horde behind him steadily approaching. Steven tore open the pack of batteries and quickly loaded it into the gun, before slotting in the bullets and loaded the gun as fast as he could. The rest of them stared at Steven like he was some sort of psychopath.
        
        “Let’s get out of this mall!” Steey suggested.
        “To where? Outside is dangerous! Do you not remember?” Jeffrey is hesitant, her voice as shaky as an earthquake unknowingly about to crack open.
        
        ANG-
        
        The gun charged up like a lawn mover, before eventually spraying a wave of bullets steadily at the incoming zombies. Just as he expected, the zombies got knocked back, and soon enough, some got knocked back until it just fell silent. The group stood still, staring at Steven in disbelief.
        
        “That, That!” The manager pointed out to the director. He pulled the scene to the larger screen screen to capture the attention of the people in the room. There stood Steven, joined by the others, slowly blasting away zombies in their path with nothing but toy guns. The director put on his pair of glasses in awe, before pulling away to head out of the room to tell the high-ups about this new finding. “Keep an eye on them, I will be back,” he made a final command before the door was shut tight.
        
        …
        
        “Phew,” Calista catches her breath. Jeffrey placed her rifle on the closed door and took a seat, exhausted from all that combat. “Wait, how does this work though? I don’t understand! How are actual guns useless yet these toy guns are actually legit?” Jeffrey questioned Steven, uncertain about how he managed to come up with such an unexpected solution of rifles. Not to mention, TOY rifles.
        
        “It's all about the force, isn’t it Steven? Too much force will just pierce right through the zombie. Whereas too little will not do anything.” Steey pulled out a possible reason as he took a seat, patiently waiting for Steven to reply.
        
        “Yeah, I think so?” Steven replied in uncertainty, and Steey ended his interrogation from there.. What was I thinking? There’s no way he would know such details about zombies.
        
        Steven began talking to his squad about his first discovery of the usefulness of the toy gun. His friend, E-man, who showed up with a Nerf pistol. Then, it worked surprisingly, so they armed themselves with stronger and automatic Nerf rifles. Then, Jeffrey turned to look at Steven’s leg which was bitten when they got to the top floor of the building.
        
        Surprisingly, Steven hasn’t turned into one of them after all these days. The bite is now fully recovered with new fresh skin, which made even himself question if the bite is actually from the zombie.
        
        “Are you a hundred percent sure it’s not the obsidian that stopped you from turning?” Jeffrey pulled out a reasoning, which Steven denied immediately.
        
        “It just can’t be, my friend who had the obsidian turned, that’s why I have the stone right now,” Steven countered, deep down hoping that he was right.
        
        “Alright, we head out tomorrow, we will take turns patrolling, just like last time,” Steey made a final say, and went to his corner to rest. Their wrists glow, signalling the start of the night. From their experiences, they knew to never fight the zombies at nighttime, so this wrist is good since it helps them indicate the time amidst the darkness of the sky. The number rolled, from 44 all the way down to 10. Holy pickles, finally. They are now in the top 10.
        
        …
        
        As she made sure the rest of the squad was asleep, she turned around and began walking towards an abandoned room where they had set up a “toilet”. She closed the door and walked out of their base, before she noticed a glimpse of light, shining on the checkered floor. In shock, she quickly pulled back and slowly manoeuvred back to their base. “I gotta tell them, I gotta tell..” 
        
        “Where do you think you’re going?” Jeffrey bumped into a man. He was tall and skinny, but his menacing height stopped her from continuing. She turned back to flee, but a red laser blinded her eyes for a second before it was re-adjusted to point at her very forehead. The glow of light that seemed to be from a handheld light started to accelerate toward her. Despite this, she was trapped. Her heart shrank, her feet cold. She turned to look beside her at the store, which is where the rest of her teammates were, before turning to the other side, and then back to the moving light.
        
        Going back to get them for help is suicide, it’s just leading the enemy to her unprepared sleeping squad. She took another glimpse at the right side of the building, but by their physical and their guns, she knew very well that she couldn’t outrun them.
        
        “What do you want?” She spoke as manly and tough as she could. The two figures from behind the light made their appearance. The one to the left holding an assault rifle, and that tall guy that was behind her walked back to be beside the guy without the rifle. 
        
        “What do you think I want?” The man said, flicking out and playing with his knife. By their stance, he is clearly the leader, and their size tells her that too.
        
        He chucked the knife at Jeffrey, and her life flashed before her eyes. She stood still, her speed unmatched with the knife. The knife zoomed right past her, cutting some of her brown hair before piercing into the half-torn wall. It remained silent, its gleaming blade casting an enigmatic shadow, leaving the surrounding air heavy with anticipation, as if time itself held its breath.
        
        “We wouldn’t want to trigger the zombies, do we?” the leader began monologuing. A zombie appeared over the corner, and they kept silent for a short moment, before it just wandered away, looking for its next prey amidst the darkness. “Now, whatever your name was, let's get to the point” and with a flick, his plump finger pointed between her eyes, ”. Join us,” the leader held out his hand.  The other two of the gangsters stood strong in front of her, with the only thing between them being nothing but the line of red amidst the darkness of the mall.
        
        This caught Jeffrey off-guard, she wasn’t expecting such a ridiculous offer. Yes, the rules did indicate that they can switch teams, but she wasn’t expecting it with such a strong group of men. The leader took a step back before he opened his mouth.
        
        “Now, you must think about this.” he spoke griminly, pointing to the sleeping children in their cosy sleeping bags. “Your team’s a joke. You got a dwarf, a juvenile, and Miss Goldilocks over there, while we.” He patted one of his men on the back, “We need no explaining, look at us!” He spoke while he and his crew flexed their muscles,“You join the top squad, and win, and in return, we get the intel we need. It’s a win-win,” the leader hovered to indicate his members to stop aiming their guns at her, which they followed instantly without any hesitation before they began walking away. She began to unconsciously reflect on the chances of her survival, before eventually remembering about Steven’s bite.
        
        “Think about it, okay?” The leader burst out a laugh, as Jeffrey just stood there, trying to process what just happened.
        
        …
        
        The clouds finally pulled away once after a really long time. The sun appeared above the horizon. 
        
        As the sunlight lay on Steven’s face, he slowly rose up and looked out the window. To him, the last time he saw the sun was more than a month ago. But for Steey and the others, they just stared out aimlessly, like the god made an appearance. 
        
        “Damn,” Jeffrey said, nearly letting out tears.
        “Let’s find food,” Steey turned around and twisted open the door. Steven followed tightly, but Jeffrey still looked out at the glowing horizon, hesitating for a while, before she was pulled by Calista and followed Steven.
        
        The city was completely empty. They scavenged for resources throughout a large part of the city, since it should be safe with such a small amount of players left. But unfortunately, it was all empty except for a few packs of chips, snacks, and water. As they walked on the footpath, the forest to their left shuffled softly, creating some sort of an illusion. Steven eyed the trees nervously, and said, “We gotta find food, guys.”
        
        “Yeah, but the city’s empty,” Jeffrey looked around the cityscape, scanning through the buildings that they’ve gone by and checked already.
        
        “Let’s try the forest, there might be something there,” Steey chimed in, realising Steven’s ominous stare at the woods.
        
        As they ventured deeper into the forest, the dense foliage blocked out much of the already fading daylight, casting eerie shadows on their path. Jeffrey’s unease grew with every step, until eventually something unexpected showed up in front of them.
        
        Zombies, in fisherman clothing and hiking gear, started to charge towards them. The rustling of the bushes and shivers of the fallen leaves as they cut through the forest must’ve caught the attention of the undead. Jeffrey’s instincts screamed at her to flee, to retreat back to the city, but Steey and Steven remained tough. With a fierce determination, Steey urged the group forward. Calista’s grip tightened on Jeffrey’s arm, her fear mirroring her own, yet Calista’s trust in Steven kept her from moving forward.
        
        As they navigated through the tangled maze of trees and vines, the relentless pursuit of the undead never ceased. No matter how much they fired, more and more started to come. The charging of the rifles triggers more and more to arrive. No matter how much they ran, the landscape remained the same, it’s as if they’ve been turning circles all this time.
        
        As the zombies closed in on them, Steven turned back to see their backs, just to notice something familiar.
        
        One of them, no, a couple of them, glowed green. That unfamiliar mysterious green that he had seen left behind an extraordinary leaf, which created an extraordinary being.
        
        “Wait!” Steven yelled and snapped a stick off a branch.
        “What what what!!!! Run you buffoon!” Jeffrey exclaimed in shock, her feet still steadily carrying her forward despite Steven being left behind.
        
        A zombie came right up to him, attempting to bite off his legs. But Steven dodged and leapt up by a branch, before dropping down and smacking it in the head twice. As the zombie tried to rebuild itself, Steven attacked the others, before landing another hit before it was about to attack again. Steey looked over at Steven, before deciding to help him. He sprinted and kicked off a root that was lumping over the ground before flicking it into shape.
        
        “Come on!” Calista hovered over Jeffrey, before pulling out her Nerf rifle and blasting the zombies that were trying to catch Steven off guard. Eventually, a glowing zombie fell to its doom, before another, and another. As Jeffrey looked over to the slowly decreasing zombies, Jeffrey began to ponder how much Steven had to experience and lose to be able to find these tactics and unknown solutions. Despite that the glowing ones fell to bits, and the ones that were not glowing still re-assembled themselves, getting weaker and slower each time. But it’s still there, just weaker. 
        
        Just as Steven expected, the zombies left behind a green glowing leaf. Being first to the rest of the squad they subconsciously stared at Steven’s palm as they fought off the zombies, eager to see what he would do next with something that was seemingly so magical.
        
        Steven plucked off a patch of grass on the ground and held it close to the glowing leaf like some mad scientist. As they contacted, tiny motes of light danced around the palm, forming intricate patterns as they swirled with the luminous glow. Eventually, revealing a couple of grass that’s larger than normal, with eyes.
        
        Steey blinked twice to confirm what he was seeing was a reality. 
        
        The grass took a spin, creating a small wave of sharp leaves which pushed the zombie further than they could imagine. It might not be as epic previously with the zombies getting stronger and harder to eliminate, but it was definitely helping them.
        
        In a swift, they outperformed the zombies. As more green zombies fell, they got more grass plants, eventually overcoming the tide and outrunning them. As Calista looked over at a patch of evolved grass, it began emoting, catching her off guard and accidentally dropping it.
        
        “What other tricks do you have up your sleeve? Eating them for camouflage???” Jeffrey joked.
        
        
        “You never know? Wanna try eating them?” Steven laughed in relief. Calista looked at them in disgust, before Steey pointed at something.
        
        “Look, a hut. And look, berries!” He pointed at a small abandoned hut. Next to it was an overgrown berry garden, filled with nutrition.
        
        They rested in the hut, consuming the little food that they had gathered from the bushes. The sounds of their chew mingled with the dead silence that surrounded them in the hut. Suddenly, a distant echo of gunfire pierced through the silence of the hut, jolting them from their brief respite. Their hearts pounded in unison, adrenaline coursing through their veins once more. With a shared glance, they knew they had to investigate.
        
        Moving swiftly but silently, they approached the window, careful not to draw unnecessary attention to themselves. As they peered out into the dim light, they were met with a chaotic scene: snipers aiming from concealed positions, the gang members darting between cover, their weapons flashing amidst the little light that flashed through the heavy clouds. Jeffrey recognized them instantly, it was the gang that gave her the offer. Then, they turned to look at the snipers, it’s the same team as before, skillfully retreating while giving relatively accurate shots. But the gang members were on the next level, using some dead bodies as their shield as they advanced quickly toward the snipers.
        
        10, Steven remembered. There were only 10 people left. He counted the number of people in front- 3 from the gang, 3 from the snipers, and them four. He turned to look at the rest of the group, taking a deep breath before he opened his mouth.
        
        “We have to fight. They are the last ones. We gotta attack them while they are weak.” The rest of them nodded. They are a relatively weak bunch, with the only powerhouse being Steey. Steven’s obsidian power was way too unreliable, Jeffrey can’t fight, and Calista is just a young girl. The only way they were to win, was to third party the opponents.
        
        Calista held the pistol, her hands shaky as she aimed down toward the man. Her finger slowly pushed the trigger, before pulling out her finger and looking up toward the brown roof of the hut. She took a deep breath and aimed again, sliding the gun onto the wooden base of the window. The rest of them looked out to the enemy in anxiety. Steven felt wrong, a feeling that wavered him in every possible move that he had made since they entered the hut. But, if they don’t kill them, they will kill us. It's kill, or be killed.
        
        Calista was no hunter, her hand shakier than the world’s largest earthquake . After a few seconds, Steey grabs the pistol off Calista, seeing her inactive. He pushed Calista back to Jeffrey, who grabbed her trembling hand in an attempt to stop it from shaking. Steey aimed toward the leader of that group in hatred, his past starting to show cracks to the others.
        
        The bullet flew superluminal, unseen to even the best of eyes. Steey had never really used actual guns before, consequently making him feel his heart race as the bullet travelled. But then, a wave of more anxiety and disappointment as he saw the gang leader’s sleeve rip, grabbing everyone’s attention. The gang quickly lowered their profile from that unexpected shot, but from another side, a single sniper stood there cowering in fear, surrounded by the corpses of his teammates. He quickly gripped his sniper rifle and aimed toward the gang, but his accuracy was horrible with his uncontrollable hands. As one other bullet was fired from the sniper, missing by a mile, the leader threw his knife right onto the sniper’s head. The sniper fell onto his knees, leaving the world behind.
        
        Steey fired a few more shots at the remaining team. But nature acted against him, cancelling his shots with earth and stone. Steey pulls out the gun’s mag to notice it empty. He throws the gun on the floor in anger, before he looks out of the window just to cause his heart to pound harder. The members, unharmed, walked out of the stone with the coast clear with their eyes on them.
        
        As they stared at each other over the green calming grass, the horrifying fact stood in front of their eyes. The cruel fact that someone would have to go without seeing the next moonlight. 
        The cruel fact that someone will have to go.
        
        Shing-
        
        “AHH!” Steey yelped in pain. His eyes quiver, as he glanced down to a blood red sharp blade, coming from his stomach. And he could only slowly and steadily turn to once a close teammate, with nothing in her eyes. He could only accept defeat, as his silk white shirt started to turn red.
        
        She pulls out the knife from Steey, making him fall onto his knees, and he muffled, in pain. She took a quick short sprint toward Calista, who took a quick step away from her. As Jeffrey slowly walked to the gang members, Steven looked at the four shadows, his fingernails scratching through the edges of reality. He remembered her words from the very beginning, “Yeah, don’t let me down guys! I will abandon you all if you’re dragging me down.” Turns out she wasn’t joking after all…
        
        “She is on our side now,” The leader patted her head like a loyal dog. Steven looked over at Jeffrey to notice her face devoid of any emotion, hiding her true intentions like a male platypus. To their surroundings, shadows seemed to flawlessly curve her surroundings. The leader sighed in joy as he slowly approached Steey while playing with his shard of anguish. Steven and Calista don’t dare to interfere, the gravity of this situation caught them too off guard to think and act.
        
        “Look who we have here, Steey?” He looked over at the fallen Steey, his pupils glimmering with victory and satisfaction. Steey spat on his face and flashed a smile, a smile so mysterious yet his presence included unbeatable strength, making him take a short step back. Steey continued to stare at him, his hands clenching his bleeding heart, as if seeking solace in the eyes of the one who caused the ache. 
        
        …
        
        Steey pulled his bag filled with supplies tight as he set foot into the heating scorches of the surrounding earth. Once he made sure the door was shut, he began walking, his footsteps echoing from the metallic ground. His surroundings remained quiet, only filled with distinct noises of construction afar. As he made a turn, a group of tough-looking Americans surrounded him. They apparently escaped from the hands of the Chinese government after fleeing a rescue ship, manned by a man with intel that showed China as a safe zone, from America to China. 
        
        “Sup Steey!” The guy in the middle pushed Steey backwards. He was the leader of the gang, the person who rescued the rest of them from the ship to escape along with him. Another guy attempted to snatch off his bag, which Steey held tight, his grip stronger than the person expected. He took a step back, with his arm in front and his expression signalling “Alright, Chill.”
        
        “I know the drill, here,” Steey threw out a pack of meat to the guy who attempted to steal his whole bag. The last thing Steey needed was to start a fight and get caught by the government. Steey started to walk off, but they weren’t done with him yet. The tall guy caught him. Steey stood still, his mind feeling no sense of escaping. The leader marched toward him to stare him right in the eye, before throwing him a punch right into his stomach, before another, and another. His smile grew after each punch, a curve like none other he had seen before, one so sharp that even that smile could make him puke. The rest of them laughed, before joining in and taking some more of his stuff. Steey entered his mind as he endured the punches. He cried on the inside, thinking back to the times he stabbed hurt and blame into those who loved him, the pain of those close to him meeting their ends one by one, the punishment of being a curse. This pain isn’t comparable to the pain they felt, no, it’s not even close to that pain.
        
        After a while, the leader was satisfied, as he tossed around the pieces of food from Steey’s backpack. As Steey began to walk off, the tall guy punched him one more time in the face, before they laughed and walked off opposite to Steey’s direction.
        
        After he jumped and leapt, he made it to the rooftop of an old outdated building. He shuffled through his near-empty bag before chucking it to the side, where it found solace. He sat on the rooftop, staring at the growing and dense futuristic city beyond. The neon light glowed in his eyes, like a flicker of hope and redemption. He took a sip off his bottle and continued to gaze outward, admiring the unimaginably exceptional innovation in a world where humanity was driven to the edge of extinction. 
        
        As he turned on his old box, the screen showcased familiar faces. He moved closer to the screen just to make a tear jerk out of his eye; Leo, Emily, and Mia, their clothes torn, their skin filled with scratches and blood.
        
        He took a step back, as a tear dropped from his eyes.
        
        The next day as he signed off his part-time job at the convenience store, he walked past the dark and deserted alleyway back to his stay. Today, he wasn’t in the mood to fight them, so he took the long route, through the blinking city scrapes.
        
        However, god has other plans.
        
        As Steey set foot onto the concrete, he felt a tap on his shoulder from behind. In disturbance, he turned to look behind him, just to notice a tall, skinny guy, whom he recognized immediately.
        
        “Look who we have here, Steey?” He said before hovering for Steey to follow him. Steey stared at him for a moment with blood in his eyes. If he could, he would just punch the crap out of him. But as he looked around the city and had a thought, he decided to just follow him as he didn’t want any trouble. He is not in the mood for trouble.
        
        “HAHALOL” Laughter was heard from the corner. As they took a turn, Steey could see eye to eye with the leader of the gang, laughing at something on his TV. 
        
        “Boss, we got Steey, this dude tried to avoid us, can you believe that!” He pulled Steey onto the centre of the gang.
        
        “You see Steey, there are two kinds of people in this world. One who is strong, the one who has hierarchy and power. The one who is willing to sacrifice everything to make the world pan out his way,” he turns to point to the screen, in which Steey subconsciously follows the invisible line. As Steey is finally facing the end, his eyes are destroyed. He grabbed his heart with one hand and began coughing. His mind began an endless parody, every word echoing to every extent of his dry skin. Curse. Curse. Curse.
        
        “The other kind,” the leader chuckled a bit, which the rest of them did too, before carrying on.
        
        “The other kind of people are cowards. Those who hide and run, knowing that they are weak. But in the end, they meet their status quo. No matter how much they try to hide and run, they will end the way they were, just like these kids.”
        
        On the screen, a Russian man was harassing Emily, whose hands were gripping onto the little life she had left. Her eye turned unsteadily around to the fallen Leo and Mia. Then, it cut off completely, redirecting the screen to a group of old people trying to outsmart them zombies.
        
        “It is pretty obvious which type you are,” He stood up and smacked Steey’s head. “But for the sake of it, I will ask you. So, what kind of people are you? Those like us, or those trash over there?” After he finished, they began laughing again, before a tough guy yelled out.
        
        “Bro they really are trashy! How can someone, no no, a team, be that weak and stupid,” He started coughing, nearly choking on his laughter, which the others laughed at too.
        
        The leader pulls out a punch toward Steey, attempting to harass him once again. But Steey wasn’t in the mood for it, he felt his anger boiling out of his soul. The numbers may seem helpless to him, but his depression was countered with desperation, leaving helplessness behind as a weakness. The punch came in slow-motion, and without thinking, he pulled out a punch with his might, fully countering the leader’s punch and sending him to the couch. 
        
        “Aargh! What the fu##!” Noticing the leader in distress, the rest of them jumped on Steey. Steey stood alone in an outnumbered fight, his mind heedless of the consequences. With anger and rage from both sides, the once cold isolated sidewalks turned into a gruesome nightmare that no human could bear witness to. 
        
        The next thing Steey knew, police, a symbol of peace except that peace,
        
        Is no longer in his dictionary.
        
        Chapter 22- Oasis of Hope
        
        “Finish them,” The leader commanded, hovering over the two Americans toward Steven and Calista. But right after they took a step, the rifleman fell to his knees in silence. The sudden shift of silence turned the other two’s attention to the fallen sniper covered in an endless flow of life.
        
        “What the-” Thrump! Before the leader could finish, Steven threw a fist right onto the tall guy, catching him off-guard. 
        
        “Ketchup,” Steey smirked.
        Steey pulls out the pistol from his back pocket. The gun lifted, each moment setting his sight closer to victory. Noticing this misconception, he quickly turned back to Steey and pressed down Steey’s gun, making him shoot to the bitter land. Oh crap.
        
        “I knew it, I knew it. The moment I saw you Jeffrey, I knew you were one of the weak,” The leader attempted to kick Steey, just to be met with a counterkick. For a split moment, they both seem to be frozen in time, neither letting the other one seize their very existence.
        …
        
        “Now that I look at you without the constant darkness and chaos, you look younger! How old are you, really?” Jeffrey looked over at Steven, examining his looks.
        
        “15, I think,” Steven replied, his voice forecasted a sound of uncertainty. Of course, by the year he was born, he should be like 20 now. The room echoed with every word, only the light of the candle seemed to hold significance in this domain of darkness.
        
        “Damn, How can I think that we are the same age? I’m 19.” Jeffrey replied in shock but her voice remained shaky and unstable. Her eyes twitched and blinked, like a caged kitten waiting for an opportunity to be free.
        
        “Tell us, what are you gonna say?” Steven integrated her. Just now, Steey and Steven witnessed her conversation with the gang leader. At first, Steven thought about rushing out and attacking, but Steey’s close observation held him down and they spectated from the darkness. 
        
        To Steven and Steey, this is a test of honesty. To Jeffrey, it’s a choice between life and death.
        
        Noticing Jeffrey’s inaction, Steven let out a sigh, of course, she would choose to go with the strong ones where she’s more likely to survive. Steey took a final glance at Jeffrey and opened to talk.
        
        “You can tell us, or I will just go back to sleep,” Steey let out a yawn, before slowly getting up from his seat.
        
        “Wait!” Jeffrey raised her hand with a desperate gaze to halt their attention.
        
        Steven was jolted by the sudden shift in the world’s atmosphere. Steey took another look into her desperate eyes and pulled out a smile. That’s the first time Steven saw a genuine smile from Steey. Jeffrey let out a puff like she was finally free from an endless swirl of darkness. Looking over at this intense yet serene situation, Steven can’t help but smile.
        
        …
        
        Steven can see the tall man’s flesh now. His mouth was all bloody and he puked out a small chip of his teeth. He stared at Steven for a split second, like he was some mere rock in the way of his survival before he began accelerating straight into Steven, catching Steven off guard. Steven expected him to throw a punch or grab a stick or something, but instead, he just sprinted directly at him, like he was nothing. The man rammed Steven with his muscles body, gripping Steven out of balance. Steven slides his feet onto the ground, pilling up dirt behind his soles. Steven pushed himself into his heart, trying to connect with his own very soul and unleash the power of the obsidian through his desperation. Stronger, Stronger!
        
        Despite his efforts, the man fully took control of the situation and smashed Steven onto the tree, making Calista yelp.
        
        Steven could feel his teeth loose and yelping in unimaginable pain. His arms were soggy and his veins could be seen. I gotta win. I gotta keep trying. I gotta keep my promise to Celestia. I gotta survive this to end this nightmare once and for all. To do that, I gotta get that favour. I need that favour.
        
        He pushed his feet onto the ground just for it to tumble back. His legs were throbbing, but noone is killing him today, not with his obsidian on his neck. He mustered up all of his strength and ignored the pain as he began to rise.
        
        He moved forward unsteadily like the undead toward the man’s back. Calista was taking cautious steps backwards, until the back of her foot was pushed onto the dead rifleman, causing her to trip and fall onto her back. 
        
        Just as the man took a standstill with his shadow covering Calista, Steven pulled off the back of his torn shirt, making the man slowly spin back toward Steven. He held his fist and an explosive surge of energy flew past his vein, channeling to the utmost front of his hand. Come on, come on!
        
        The punch landed with a resounding impact, the obsidian gleaming fiercely as the force of the blow sent a gust of wind rippling through Steven’s hair. As the dust cleared up a bit, the man’s coughing can be heard. Steven took a step back from the undefeated man. To his dismay, it merely left a scar on the man’s face, stoking the flames of his rage to new heights.
        
        Despite Jeffrey’s constant attempts to aid him, Steey found himself locked in a fierce battle against the formidable leader. The clang of steel echoed through the air as their kicks collided, each blow sending shockwaves of pain through Steey’s body. If just I hit that shot with the pistol, or if I just saved two extra bullets instead of just one in my pocket.
        
        Despite his best efforts, he couldn’t gain the upper hand against the skilled adversary.
        
        The leader jumped in an attempt to use his other leg to land a kick on Steey. With a swift reaction, he used his other hand to block off the kick, making the leader slowly fall to the ground. But right before he hit the ground, he took a swift spin, getting his leg out of contact with Steey’s before reaching for a low spin kick, making Steey nearly tripping. As Steey did a backflip to stop himself from tripping, Jeffrey attempted to throw a fist at the leader, only for her fist to be grabbed by him before she flew away, her hands filled with mud.
        
        Ducking and weaving through the onslaught of attacks, Steey fought with everything he had. Every movement was calculated, and every strike was aimed with precision, yet the leader seemed to anticipate his every move. With each passing moment, Steey felt his energy waning, his muscles aching from the endless parody. Jeffrey eventually stopped assisting Steey as she noticed herself being a burden for him, it’s like letting him battle while needing to protect his useless body double. So, she looked around, before vanishing into the woods.
        
        As the battle raged on, Steey’s resolve began to falter. Doubt crept into his mind as he struggled to keep pace with his opponent's relentless onslaught. How am I losing? How am I losing? The words echoed through his mind. He thought he was prepared after all those years of self-torture, but the thought of them being trained military personnel is starting to glow light into the situation.
        
        Just when all hope was lost, a loud bang was heard. The man’s stomach seemed to extend to an inhumane scale, before he dropped to the floor, his mind unable to process what had just happened. As the man was dropped to the floor, behind him revealed Steven. His fist forward now pointing Steey from what seemed like miles away. Steey stared at the fantasy, how Steven’s fist wasn’t even in contact with the leader, yet he still managed to send a strong punch from the leader’s back. His fist glowed a faint black, like the colour of the obsidian, before it cooled back to its usual skin colour. Steey can tell that Jeffrey was shocked on the sidelines, but Steven looks calmer than the sea, staring directly towards Steey with his dark pupils steady and emotionless.
        
        She placed her makeshift bow and arrow on the wet red grass to form up with the group. She joged past the down rifleman and the tall dude with an arrow pierced through his skull.
        
        The leader was somehow still conscious. He shuffled his hands across the mud and tried to get up, but his pain contradicted his will, causing him to fall once again.
        
        “Sh##,” he swore as Steey stood strong in front of him. His motion became uncoordinated as he tried to get out of this unfavourable situation. Steey took another kick to stop him from crawling away.
        “No, you’re wrong,” Steey began, the leader tried to avoid eye contact, but with the limited sight, he was unconsciously forced to admit defeat.
        “There is a third kind of person, one who hides and stays on the sideline of the spotlight. Until the time comes when it’s no longer an option, that’s when they will unleash their true inner beast and crush those who threaten their very lives and their loved ones. In the end, it’s not the strongest one who claims the throne, it’s the one who knows when and where to use their power.” Steey finished and threw a final kick into the man’s face.
        
        Bang!
        
        The bullet ripped out Jeffrey’s soul as it pierced through her beating heart, leading her to slowly fall deeper, and deeper, into the darkness of the abyss.
        
        “Jeffrey!” Steven shouted and ran toward her with the pain of his legs. He knew very well that his little pain wasn’t anything compared to Jeffrey’s current state. Steven stared red-eyed at the barely conscious rifleman, who pulled out a smile, one that only Steven could tell it’s a sign of mock and laughter. “See you in hell.” Steven calmly spoke, his inner anger overflowing his flesh and mind. He pulls his right fist tight to turn its colour into the faint obsidian glow from previously, before unleashing it to put an end to the man’s unwanted existence. 
        
        Jeffrey stayed motionless with her arms stretched across the now cherry grass, pulling out of her consciousness from time to time as she blinked with her eyes red. Steey followed tightly behind Steven towards Jeffrey before they dropped to their knees, staring into her barely open eyes. Her breathing was unsteady as Steey placed his finger to test her pulse. Steey felt another stone dropping into the depths of his already rocky heart. Once again, he survived, but his survival was the cause of another death.
        
        Jeffrey looked up to the sky, her eyes filled with regret. But underneath the tears, she pulled out a smile.
        
        “Don’t you die on me. Don’t you dare!” Steven’s voice getting shakier with fear and desperation, his emotions raw as he pleaded to stop this horrendous eternal loop. No more sacrifices. PLEASE.
        
        …
        
        It was when I was no more than a teen when my parents decided to bring us to the United States in search of the “American dream”.
        
        We are just a normal family- mom, dad, an older sister named Lana, another older brother named Luis who is already out working, and myself, and a lively younger sister named Fara.
        
        Every day as I came back from the modern American school, my home would be filled with the aroma of Vietnamese spices and the melodic sounds of laughter.
        
        “Fara, come help me mix these,”
        “Yes, Mom!” Fara yells from across the hallway. After putting her towel on the rack outside to dry, she hurried across to help.
        
        “I’m back!” I greeted and walked across to my room for a change of fresh clothes.
        
        And the day would go by like this- waking up later than I had to in Vietnam, school being easier than it used to be in Vietnam once you understand English, and less work than there used to be in Vietnam. This frees up more time for myself, to spend on the things that I like and my loved ones.
        
        But as I slowly got used to this comforting lifestyle, I slowly pushed myself to the gates of the devil. I began playing more and more video games, spending less and less time with my loved ones, and started to argue more and more as I wished for more and more.
        
        “Come on Mom, let me play for another hour!” I used to argue. 
        “You know it’s way past your bedtime. Go to sleep now!” 
        “But my friends are still online!”
        “Stop arguing, just go to sleep!”
        “I hate you!!!” I shouted and stomped away. My older sister would break open her bedroom door, and tell me off, but I rarely gave a sh## and just slam shut my bedroom door.
        
        As heated arguments became more and more common in our home, it felt like the feeling of a haven began slipping away.
        
        
        As I slowly got older, I soon realised that maybe, an argument isn’t the way to go. As I witnessed my little sister’s emotions getting more and more out of hand, I stopped for a moment and slowly thought back in time. Why am I like this?
        
        As every day passed, my little sister got more and more aggressive, it made me sick. My older sister, Lara, has been blaming it on America’s poor moral education, saying that we’ve been too easy on her and made her weak and disrespectful just like the natives here, but my mother always hoped that she would change, she says that we should just give her “more time”. I’ve been coming home later and later, but no matter how much I tried to run, I also ended up spectating their hideous argument.
        
        One fateful night, tension reached a breaking point. Fara’s voice rose to a deafening pitch as she unleashed a torrent of expletives, directed not only at her parents but at the very essence of their identity. The atmosphere crackled with the intensity of the argument.
        
        My mom, already on the verge of tears struggled to maintain her composure. “Fara, enough! You cannot speak to us like this!”
        
        But Fara paid no heed, her rebellious spirit fueling her rampage. The cacophony of her shouts echoed through the house. Leaving an unremovable mark on the once-peaceful home.
        
        Unable to bear the escalating chaos any longer, Lana slammed open her door to intervene. She grabbed Fara’s shoulders, attempting to restrain her. “Stop it, Fara! You’re tearing this family apart! You can’t treat Mon and Dad like this!”
        
        “You think you’re better than me, Lana? Just because you’re a know-it-all college girl? You’re just as stupid as they are!” Fara screamed, making Lara hold her down harder.
        In her blind fury, Fara tried to break free, flailing and resisting Lara’s attempts to calm her down. Lana’s patience had already worn thin and found herself in the whirlwind of emotions that engulfed our home.
        
        “Enough! Lara, let go of her!” My father contorted with pain, both physical and emotional trying to mediate between my sisters. Lara scoffed and let go of her, their eyes filled with rage and anger.
        
        “Please Fara, we are family. We need to support each other,” he implored, his voice strained with both heartache and the physical toll of the argument.
        
        “Fara, just stop this. Stop restraining your father, don’t you know his heart condition!” Mother gave up trying to teach her. We all did, all we wanted was for this horrendous nightmare to come to an end.
        
        But Fara, blinded by her rebellion, sneered at her father. “Heart condition? More like Dad was just too weak to handle life. Maybe he deserved it.”
        
        Maybe he deserved it
        
        The phrase echoed through my head, as I stared at the corpse of my family, crushed by the fallen buildings. Everyone had fled, but I stood there to notice Fara’s trembling hand raising from atop the pierced glass. I took a step forward in the hopes of saving her, but my heart was telling me otherwise. She deserved it. She deserves this death. My mind would echo, but my mind continued to propel me forward to my little sister, just as I was metres away, a man grabbed my arm, propelling me forward to dodge a falling roof.
        
        “Sorry. You okay? It’s too late, they were goners,” The man patted on my back.
        “I’m OK,” I replied. The man decides to quickly change the topic after such a devastating event for such a young kid.
        “So, what should I call you?” The man eventually asked me. I let out a tear as I saw my school name tag hanging off my shredded uniform; Mara. I turned over to look at the street sign, standing strong without any dust despite its collapsed surroundings. Jeffrey Street, it said. I turned back to look in the eye of the man and slowly parted my lips.
        
        “Jeffrey, you can call me Jeffrey.”
        
        …
        
        She looked over at Calista.
        “Looking at her pisses me off, she reminds me of her, that little piece of sh##.”
        
        “ARGH,” Jeffrey screams in pain, holding her knee as flesh and blood are visible to the sun. She took a heavy breath and spoke for a final time.
        
        “But, but looking at you guys, complete strangers at first, but you lot did life-threatening things for each other. How can I hold… onto hatred for my own kin when you’re out there risking it all. You’ve shown me… love knows no boundaries. I’m grateful. You’ve made me see.. Family sticks together. How can  we not talk about family when that’s all we’ve got? They were there every… step of my life. It’s okay to see shades of gray. It’s okay to cling to hope. She taught me that. It’s okay to feel… the anger, the sadness. As long as amidst all the chaos, we realise that the little things matter. You lot shown me the true definition of a family, and I appreciate that, I truly, and, and, and-” She coughed out some blood, and wiped it away from her red lips.
        
        “We just gotta appreciate, we just gotta be happy, for the little time that we have in this world.”
        
        …
        
        “So, what do you want? Money? Power? Status? Job?” The man questioned the three of them. The sound of the engines and the rotating blades of the helicopter was still louder than an earthquake, making the man yell at the top of his lungs. But they could barely make out what the man was saying, so they just stared at him with puzzled looks. The man attempted another time, before giving in and offering them to enter his office.
        
        He repeated to them, leaving Steey stuck in thought, and Calista started discussing with her sister. Steven stared straight into the eyes of the man, whose moustache seemed to make his identity feel rather ominous.
        
        “Andle,” Steven spoke assertively, catching the rest of his squad and Celestia off guard.
        
        “I want a plane to take me back to Andle.”
        
        …
        
        The plane began its steady decline. Steven looked out of the window to notice the familiar runway that was once filled with zombies chasing them.
        
        “Remember, be back by 8 pm or we are leaving without you,” the pilot spoke to him. Steven pulled open the door and walked off the metallic echoes of the steps. Until a thump, he touched the concrete ground, which made him wobble a bit since the last time he walked on concrete was a whole month ago. The pilot pulled the door shut, leaving Steven all alone in the middle of a massive abandoned runway. Grass grew through the tiny cracks in the concrete, making the whole runway feel even more ominous. He walked through the terminal, until reaching its oversized entrance.
        
        To his right stood an abandoned old pickup truck. It took a while before he recognized it, it was the same old vehicle they had all squeezed into for the ride to the airport. Now as he took a step closer to it, it made him ponder how they managed to all fit into it back then. 
        
        He took a seat on the driver’s wheel and drove off towards his objective, The Clouds Tower. The surroundings turned hazy as he exceeded the pointless speed limit. His speed now unmatched by the zombies, he lay back in his seat comfortably, as the scene constantly changed from massive hordes in retail areas to the quiet depths of the suburb.
        
        Noticing his barely visible fuel line, he hopped off at a local petrol station hoping to either get some petrol or switch vehicles. Also, he could begin to hear his stomach rumbling.
        
        As he set foot into the surprisingly clean gas station. He nearly stumbledtripped over a tripwiretrip wire. But thanks to Steey’s lesson, he managed to land perfectly. However, the alarm starter blaring louder than the quake of Underneath.
        
        “Shoot,” Steven looked around in panic; the zombies are gonna get alarmed by the noise. He took another step in quickly, hoping to grab what he needed and get out of there. But to his surprise, the shelves were empty and rather uniquely organisedorganized. He turned to where the sound was comingof coming from and started to sprint towards it, only to trip from another wire. Except that this time, it got him unexpectedly, making him fall with his face to the ground.
        
        “Damn, that must hurt,” a familiar voice appeared behind him. Soon after he spoke, the alarm was shut off, and footsteps could be heard surrounding him.
        “Stay back, we don’t know what he wants,” another voice responded.
        
        Steven slowly turned to have his hands on the ground facing the shadows. A glimpse of light was shone on Steven’s face, making him go blind. As Steven hovered his hands over the light, he slowly widened his pupils. In that poignant moment, amidst the grim and dark backdrop of the zombie apocalypse, a shadow reminiscent of the hallowed halls where youthful whispers once filled the air like the rustle of autumn leaves was cast. Overwhelmed by disbelief and relief, a tear escaped his eye, tracing a silent path down his cheek, as if the floodgates of his heart had finally been opened by the bittersweet reunion with the echoes of a time before the world had crumbled. hello
        
        “Steven?” The figure in front of him asked.
        
        As Steven’s eyes adjusted to the dim light, he realisedrealized he was surrounded not only by some familiar faces but all of them from his core class, 15Z back in the day. As he noticed them being alive after this long dimmed a light of hope into Steven’s heart. 
        
        A couple of his closest classmates ushered him into a spacious room stocked with supplies and food. Six other doors leading off from the main room hinted at bedrooms. They all seemed surprised that Steen hadn’t aged a day in the past five years. Noticing their confusion, Steven explained about the glowing obsidian necklace that he wore, a relic symbolising sacrifice and friendship from his past adventures.
        
        “Do you happen to be with Elijah, Bob, Xander, or even Luxury?” Ezu, one of his closest classmates, asked him about their other lost classmates. Steven’s expression immediately darkened as he recounted the events that led to their apparent deaths. Blyde, sensing the discomfort in the room, quickly changed the subject.
        
        “No weapons?” Blyde asked, noticing Steven’s unarmed state.
        “Not even a stick?” Rhill further emphasisedemphasized.
        “Yeah,” Steven replied. He remembered Celestia offering him his sword before he left, but he declined, feeling confident in his own abilities with his fist, the obsidian, and the combat strategies that Steey taught him. “Make sure to come back, I will be waiting for you,” Celestia said as she hugged him.
        
        “Wait, how are you all alive?” Steven couldn’t help but question how his classmates survived the apocalypse tilltil now.
        
        They explained that they had narrowly escaped death by hiding out in the sports shed by Pamala Stone. They were having a pizza morning tea to celebrate the end of speeches with their English teacher, Mrs Williams. Once the initial wave occurred, Mr Narb, their PE teacher, happened to be there putting away sporting equipment. So, they tried their best to squeeze inside safely. They remained hidden for about a day or two until the screams and disgusting sounds of consumption were no longer heard.
        
        As the reality of their situation sunk in, Steven couldn’t shake the feeling of guilt and regret. What if I remembered? What if instead of playing games during mathsmath I told my friends and alarmed Luxury to warn the class about the Pizza morning tea? Then maybe they would’ve survived, they would’ve all survived.
        
        “So you said you came from an underground city?” Blyde further inspected Steven, hoping to extract possible information.
        
        “Yeah, it’s safe there under a horrendous condition,” Steven explained about theexplained the underground city of China, the Battle Royale, and how he came back to find out more about his obsidian.
        
        “Woah, so you survived such a competition? That’s insane, ” Ezu said before some of them began eyeing him. “What?” Ezu questioned in confusion.
        
        “There’s a helicopter waiting for me at the airport. You guys can come with me to safety if you want. Don’t worry about the battle royale though, my friend Steey has an extra favour from the government that he told me he would gladly use for me as long as it’s for good since he doesn’t want to owe me for saving his life, twice.” Steven spoke assertively as he took a sip out of the packeted milk, a flavour that he had longed for.
        
        “What if the government doesn’t accept this as a favour?” Anthony, the uncertain one in the classroom pondered the possibility.
        
        “If that doesn’t work, it doesn’t matter. I am gonna end this apocalypse before the next Battle Royale. Trust.” Steey slammed the empty box onto the table, his eyes showing his eagerness and desperation. 
        
        “You, stopping all this?” Anthony laughed before he was quickly silenced by Rhill.
        
        “Do you have a plan?” Blyde looked at Steven, patiently wishing for positive news.
        
        “If you are gonna save the world, fight me first. Then we can see whether or not you are actually worthy,” Mr Narb interrupted the conversation, appearing from the front door with more supplies and Mrs Williams, looking shocked and concerned about the conversation that they heard while entering the room.
        
        Then, they began to have a friendly fight. At first, Steven seemed to be at a disadvantage, but then as seconds passed, he slowly got back into the habit of using his powers to his liking, such as for ranged and close combat, including reaching new limits that far exceeded his previous capabilities. In just under two minutes, Steven absolutely destroyed Mr Narb, despite the fact that Mr Narb was fit and strong being a PE teacher. Steven’s finger was in full contact with Mr Narb’s neck, before eventually, Mr Narb responded with a chuckle. “Alright, you win.”
        
        “Remember, before 8 pm at the airport if you decide to come,” Steven confirmed to them, before Mrs Williams pulled out a wave of goodbye and good luck before they were all gone, vanished into the room to discuss this matter among themselves, leaving Steven with some food, drinks, and a bottle of fuel.
        
        …
        
        “Oh, Steven!” Blyde shouted towards Steven. He waved back at the group as the pilot slowly walked towards him with a mix of confusion and anxiety.
        
        “You know these people?” He asked him with his brows furrowed, creating deap lines on his forehead as he tilted his head slightly to the side.
        
        “Yeah, I was hoping if you can take them back with us. Tell the person in charge that this will be for Steey’s favour that they won’t have to do the battle royale too as they head to the city,”
        
        “All goods?” Mr Narb questioned him with a thumbs up in his left arm. Some of them turned to Steven expecting for a response.
        
        “Yeah!” Steven yelled back, before facing the pilot.
        “Do you think that we can get them back in one go?” Steven showed signs of desperation, his eyes curling into the eyes of puppies. The man sighed before he grabbed out a scuffed-looking makeshift phone. He took a quick dial and spoke in some other language.
        
        “We can take them back, but they will have to participate in the battle royale, that’s the term, or else it’s a no-go. So?” The man pulled his phone away from his ear as he asked the question. Steven took a quick breath, then swallowed nervously as he locked eyes with the man. A shadow of darkness crossed Steven’s face, hinting at an impending decision. His expression turned more serious, one that foreshadowed a sense of desperation. “Yeah, I accept the terms,” he stated definitively, as another heavy rock was placed onto his already sore back.
        
        …
        
        As Steven set foot onto the cold steps of the steel, the pilot rushed past him, pushing him off balance. Steven looked over at the panicked pilot, migrating through the crowd into the distance with his phone tightly on his ear. 
        
        “What’s going on?” Anthony pondered as the rest of them set foot outside of the plane. 
        
        BOOM!
        
        An explosion was heard, causing the view of a rage of fire up ahead in the suburban apartments. This caught them off guard, causing Steven to reflexively lower his profile. Soon after, another one is heard to the left, and another one to the right. Soon after, a part of the roof came falling onto the megalopolis, causing the neon futuristic city to be covered in brown and grey. The darkness of the sky engulfed the city through the hole, with only a single dot of light holding power as it lowered from the crack above them.
        
        It glowed brighter and brighter in red. All the screens turned to display an image of a man, tall and tough-looking. His face showcased a sign of being Canadian as he set foot onto the heavy mud. They all had their eyes on the suddenly brightened screens, hoping for an explanation of this mess. 
        
        On man’s flank stood tanks and unfamiliar futuristic forces unlike anything that they’d seen before. Amidst the chaotic scene hollowed on the displays, a figure seized Steven’s attention, a face that’s etched permanently into his memory.
        
        Anthony’s eyes widened in recognition of a long-lost friend, his voice faltering in disbelief.
        
        Steven met Anthony’s gaze, his own eyes widening.
        
        “Isn’t that Noah?”
        
        The one sentence he prayed to have misheard, but his eyes confirmed it clear as day. Steven turned one more gaze at the display of both misfortunes and hope, before Mr kythagoras’s lips started to part, and the speaker started to bloom a horrendous monologue that was as devilish as Hades himself.
        
        “Surrender,”
        
        He raised the gun.
        
        “or DIE.”
        
        Chapter 23- Red River
        
        KABOOM
        
        From their backs, a loud and close blast was heard. In an instant, the plane was engulfed with flames, with the only thing visible other than the hell being a massive shell struck halfway between the plane’s outer wall. Steven slowly adjusted his head back to the screen, his eyes fixated on the seemingly impossible.
        
        A man bashed past his shoulder without realising it, putting him off balance and facing back towards his classmates for a split second. To his right, the man still cursing the hell out of him as he accelerated away, but Steven was more interested in his left, where his classmates were scrambling in full-blown panic.
        
        Did I make a mistake? Should I have never brought them here?
        
        He took another glance at his classmates to realise they slowly getting guided away from Mr Narb.
        
        “Come, quick!” Anthony shouted to Steven, shaking him back to reality.
        
        More people were getting urgent, as more and more people rushed past him in all directions. Fighter jets began taking off one after another, just for the unfortunate pilots to get shot down by anti-air missiles. 
        
        He stared at Anthony for a while, before his mind was steered clear of the fog.
        
        Questions later, this is more important, guiding them to safety in this unfamiliar terrain. It is my responsibility, being the one who brought them into this mess in the first place.
        
        “This way,” Steven manages to spurt out after forming up with them, taking the lead. His mind was filled with Steey’s description of his place; large and open, allowing for possible modifications, yet located far away from the centralopolis, almost as far as you can go in this underground city.
        
        He stared over the long stretch of road that led towards nothing but earth. Six, no, seven blocks away.
        
        “Steven,” someone taps his back just as he is about to start jogging.
        “Hey man, you feeling good?” It’s Mr Narb, trying to smile as brightly as he could. “Just tell you, it's none of your fault. None of us expected this.”
        “Thanks,” Steven nodded, putting aside his guilt. Despite this, he still felt a heavy sense of responsibility deep within his consciousness. Mr Narb just slaps his back, “Don’t go too hard on yourself.”
        
        They began cruising towards safety, but something stood before their way just as they got their hopes up.
        
        Tanks, painted with blue and black stripes can be seen, crossing their path. As the tank decelerated, the turret turned to point at Steven and the rest of them upon hearing their footsteps and breathing. Its barrel reddened, a sight that sent a horrifyingly unpleasant feeling to them, making them shiver. Despite its sick look, Steven wishes to never find out its eradicating strength. Just the thought of him and his classmates turning non-existence in a split second makes him want to puke.
        
        To their luck, a couple of red-grey tanks appeared from the other side of the crossroad right in front of the enemy tanks. Steven stared at the slow barrel, turning elegantly towards the enemy. Come on, hurry up you slowpoke!
        
        Eventually, it blasted a heavy shell, followed by more, and more from tanks behind. As the dust was cleared, their hopes were once again crumbled. To their surprise, its blue stripes remained intact, and not a scar was seen. Noticing the ineffectiveness, they tried to fall back, just to face the inevitable.
        
        “What are those super-tanks?” Blyde yelled out amidst the constant blasting of chaos. This made Steven ponder for a moment. In this time and age, people should be working hard trying to survive and rebuild society. So how could they come out with new, better technology in such an apocalyptic world?
        
        “Steven,” Someone shouted from behind. In suddenness, he quickly turned to face head to head with Mr Narb, his face trying to show calmness, but deep into the abyss of his eyes, Steven could see traces of fear and desperation.
        
        “Can we still make it to this “safe” place?” Mr Narb questioned, placing Steven deep into the ocean of his experience, Steey’s description, and common sense. He looked around for possible alleyways and paths, until reaching a sequence of tracks that hadn’t been blocked with flames. This might work, this better work.
        
        Steven began rushing down the alleyway. Without words exchanged, the rest followed. As Anthony who is the last one of the pack, escaped from the open street, the beam of death blasted behind them on the concrete ground, leaving nothing but lava.
        
        As Steven turned and cornered around the tight gaps, the light of the end finally made a heated appearance. His legs continued shuffling as he turned to look behind him, just to notice Mr Narb’s concerned look.
        
        “We’re nearly there,” Steven pulled out a smile, making him let out a quiet sigh of relief.
        
        Just as Steven was turning his head back to the front, his right foot was hooked onto something in front, causing him to fall.
        
        As he fell forward onto the cold ground, a man in front of him yelped out in pain. The voice stung Steven like a bee, a voice so familiar yet ominous, one that provoked his inner guilt.
        
        “Holy shoot Elijah what have you done this time,” a voice came from further ahead.
        
        Elijah? Steven slowly redirected his head from the ground. There stood a face, one that he could never forget. A face so similar, yet so different. No way in the heavens.
        
        He turned to look back up towards the other familiar voice, there stood Liam. And then Luxury was seen sprinting from the corner to the back of Liam, followed by Charlotte, and then more, and more faces appeared.
        
        Mr Narb’s voice broke through the haze of Steven’s thoughts, pulling him back to the present. His eyes widened as he took in the sight of familiar faces emerging from the shadows. Luxury, Charlotte, and others, faces from his past, faces he never thought he’d see again.
        
        Despite the shock, Steven quickly realised they were all in danger thanks to Mr Narb’s sudden voice. They needed to move, and fast. Pushing himself from the ground, he glanced around, assessing their surroundings.
        
        “We have to keep moving,” Mr Narb said, his voice urgent. “They’re closing in on us.
        
        “What about them?” Steven was staring into the reflection of his past, his eyes filled with a mixture of relief and shame as he fell deeper and deeper into the abyss.
        
        “Come with us, there’s no time!” Blyde suggested upon reaching beside them. Mr Narb turned to nod, before hovering them to follow.
        
        They ran.
        
        Steven peered out through the corner, before he set prey on the haven that looked just as Steey described to him; its former glory glowing through the cracks of dust, mud slipping through the metallic flooring surrounding it, with algae thriving.
        
        Just as Steven was about to knock on the door, the entrance was pulled open from the inside. Behind, featuring Celestia and her everlasting smile.
        
        “What took you so long?” her eyes glimmered onto Steven’s glare, refusing to let go. After a long few seconds passed, she snapped around accidentally conveying her half-glowing cheeks.
        
        “Oh, come on in,” she stood aside letting all of them in.
        
        As they rushed in, Blyde took a moment to stroll looking at the building that was once considered unexistance to humanity before the apocalypse; an underground building. Eventually, he let himself in, shutting the door behind him.
        
        “Wow you got a rich girlfriend Steven, I see!” Blyde exclaimed, causing Steven to stutter in a mixture of shock and embarrassment.
        
        “No, she’s, and, this is another friend of mine’s place, Steey, whose…” He quickly observed his surroundings, trying to catch a glimpse of Steey.
        
        “Steey said he’s gotta go and do something. He said he will be right back.” Celestia said noticing Steven’s sight of confusion.
        
        “Oh, my bad.” Blyde spurted out. The rest of his classmates seemed to be settling in, creating invisible dividers of territories within the building.
        
        Just as Steven was about to walk away from the entrance, Blyde peers beside his ear for another whisper.
        “But you gotta admit it, she’s kinda cute don’t you think? Especially in your age’s perspective?” Steven moved his head away from Blyde in disgust. Blyde just chuckled, before he walked away to join Ezu and some other classmates in opening a packet of fruits from the flight here.
        
        Steven can’t help but scan Celestia. Yeah, she is cute, very cute. Her similar eyes and her warm smile…
        
        Like a primal instinct of being watched, Celestia felt Steven’s gaze, who quickly turned to walk towards Mr Narb. What was I dreaming about, we are in the middle of a war, you dumb nobody.
        
        “Hi Steven!” a voice came from underneath. There stodd Calista, the young kid, no more than 10, dragged into a deadly fight for survival with him. That same girl who witnessed bloodshed and the disgust now letting out her inner ch8ild from her previous vegetable personality.
        
        “Oh hi, didn’t see you there.” Steven smiled.
        
        “Come on, stop bothering Steven,” Celestia told her sister, before she turned to Steven once again.
        
        “We need a meeting, right?” She asked, her voice feeling the Steven’s inner crowd of emotions as the heavy tension burned through the room.
        
        “Yeah…” He hovered his hands to gesture Mr Narb who gestured some more important figures.
        
        …
        
        “So, do we really have this whole place to ourselves?” Mr Narb started the meeting.
        
        “Yeah, Steey took over and unlocked all of the doors right after everyone fled. He used to live on the rooftop of this building,” Celestia explained.
        
        One by one, their questions were answered and the apocalyptic state of the world started to fit together like a massive puzzle. Norman explained the New mega city founded by Mr Kythagoras and its hidden dark truth, while Steven explained this underground network of cities founded by China along with the Battle Royale, a survival game designed to provide the government with information.
        
        Then, Steven told them about the whole time travelling business from Ethan’s gift, the obsidian necklace, just to get cursed by Elijah.
        
        “Excuses for a coward,” he scoffed.
        
        “Elijah is it? it’s not like he could’ve avoided that, it was unexpected. Stop blaming him for it.” Celestia took Steven’s stand, making him smile for a moment. But she wasn’t all correct, and he knows it clear as day, pushing him into a tide of a mixture of feelings. Maybe if I didn’t exert any extreme emotions at that time, things would be different. Maybe If I didn’t, I would be there with them, fighting together, and maybe, we might’ve won. Maybe, we would’ve saved the world.
        
        “Enough of that, how did you lot escape in the first place?” Mr Narb put his foot down, catching the silence of the whole room. Norman put his hand up for a moment to break the silence, before his lips began to part.
        
        …
        
        “How could that jerk just turn his back on us like that?” Elijah bashed his chains against the cold prison ground, his anger boiling out uncontrollably.
        
        “Is this finally the end?” Charlotte said depressingly. After all we’ve been through, after all of our efforts, is this finally the end of all these struggles? 
        
        “No,” Luxury spoke coldly. No, I will not let my book end like this. This will not be the end of me.
        
        “Maybe you lot just to calm down. Instead of being depressed or angry or whatever, we need to think of an initiative. What can we do now?” The commander spoke in a voice that shunned even the angriest, leaving the cell with a sudden surge of silence.
        
        “The commander is right guys, maybe we just need to think,” Liam attempted to suppress their feelings in order to move ahead. His old charm of calming the atmosphere seemed to drive them forward in this apocalypse, and he is keen on using it in order to continue surviving.
        
        The dawn of silence awakened. Each of them dived deep into their own minds, trying to sort out their emotional and strategic packages. Without them realising, the outside door opened, shining a glimmer of light through the cold castle floor.
        
        “Look,” Norman said with a sense of curiosity in his darkened voice. As they turned their attention to the sudden contrast, a dark figure appeared, causing most of them to feel even more boiled.
        
        “You glue-eating, coke snorting, crack smoking, child-smelling, lobotomized liberal!” Elijah leaped himself onto the jail door, his hand gripped tightly onto the bars, “You’re no better than Oliver!” Elijah shook the bar of steel, imitating his inner mind.
        
        “Shut it!” he yelled, everyone stopped and looked at him. Elijah’s face softened instantly. A surge of heat waves murdered his face like an ace, wet with tears and heavy breaths. “Shut it, all of you! You all left me! You all just ran like coyotes, not even peering back to see if your friend had the slightest chance of survival! You all left me there to DIE!” The last word shook the room. Noah’s shaky breath coupled with his hasty gasping. He faced Elijah who ungripped the bars, “So Elijah, I ask you again,” he said and his voice quietened to a small vengeful whisper, 
        
        “Who’s the true traitor here?”
        
        And with that, Noah yeets the tray of food onto the ground. He stared at the group in a mixture of rage and regret, before the door was roared to a close.
        
        “There goes our food,” Norman sighs, before turning to Elijah.
        “Why can’t you just hold your anger, now we will starve for another day. How are we meant to plot an escape with our empty stomach?” As Luxury observed the disgusting food, an outsider put a flame onto her cold eyes.
        
        She tiptoed over subconsciously. Her fingers twisted as she was attracted closer and closer until her finger felt a touch, a gentle feeling. With two fingers, she snatched out a silver object. 
        
        “What are you doing?” Charlotte looked over at the focused Luxury. As Luxury slowly turned to face her, her eyes widened for the first time since they first spotted this glimmering-looking metropolis.
        
        There, in the middle of Luxury’s palms, lay something left to them by a friend they once thought was lost.
        
        A key.
        
        …
        
        “Wait, so Noah is on their side now? No wait, he gave you the key, so he’s on our side? Wait what I’m confused now…” Celestia questioned in a desperate tone.
        “I don’t know, but maybe the biggest mistake was jumping out through the ventilation out of Underneath and never coming back to check on him,” Liam said.
        
        “I mean like, who would expect him to still be alive? After all those zombies back there? It wasn’t really your fault, alright?” Mr Narb attempts to cool the room. Steven settled into a more comfortable position, his gaze slowly turning to see Celestia, who is rather, uncomfortable…
        
        “Why Celestia? Something wrong?” he questioned in the hopes of understanding her sudden verge of tension.
        
        “Umm…” She gulped before continuing
        
        “Why isn’t Steey back yet?”
        
        The room came into a deep silence for a moment, before Norman turned to look at Celestia.
        
        “The guy who introduced this building to the rest of us, right?”
        
        They sat motionless for a moment, before Steven tidied his shirt and stood up from his seat.
        
        “I will go find him,” Steven asserted firmly.
        
        “Wait, do you even know where he went?” Celestia yelped, her voice growing unsteady and cracky as her heartbeat continued to speed up. She took the lead with Steven following tightly behind her as they marched up the stairs to reach an open balcony. To his dominant side lay a makeshift rooftop and a mattress.
        
        As they approached Steey’s lair, an insignificant piece of material lay abandoned on the soft cushioning, catching their attention.
        
        “Thank you for everything you all have done. I gotta go do something dangerous for the sake of my selfish guilt. Bye forever. From, Steey…”
        BYE FOREVER…
        
        “I am coming with you,” Celestia said with a tone as brave as she could make out, but her inner fear hindered her performance. Steven hurriedly sprinted down the stairs, one step breaking in the process from the age of the building. Celestia tried to keep up with his momentum, but Steven’s mind and action were on another level, a level that omitted black ashes from his aura.
        
        “Hey, I heard about that friend Steey, I will come, we will all come with you,” Liam rushed up a step just to retreat immediately as Steven gently pushed him out of the way.
        
        “Right guys?” Liam looked over to his team.
        
        “I am going for revenge Steven, count me in,” Luxury’s voice rang out with determination. Liam turned once more toward the emotionless Steven to stop him in his tracks, hoping to get acceptance.
        
        “No!” Elijah’s cold shout jumped the whole atmosphere.
        “You’re deluded if you think we stand a chance against those things. We’re nothing but ants in its path.” Elijah’s words felt like a slap in the face to Luxury’s selfish attempts. The words continued to cut like icy blades, revealing his reluctance to repeat past failures. Despite their inner protests, they couldn’t refute Elijah’s harsh logic. 
        
        “I am not gonna allow any of you to go in there and repeat the past,” he confirmed harshly, before settling into the couch.
        
        “Yeah, you lot stay behind, I shall go in, alone,” Steven’s jaw clenched as he replied.
        
        “Let me come with you, Steven. I can help,” Celestia stepped forward, her eyes pleading.
        
        Steven shook his head without a moment of thought.
        
        “No, Celestia. I won’t put you in danger.”
        
        Their words hung heavy in the air, each one grappling with the gravity of the situation and the risks ahead.
        
        “Steven you sure? This ain’t like some video game where you can respawn if you fail. This is the real deal! Why don’t we just stay here and hope for the best, now that we are all finally together?” Liam attempted to persuade Steven, but Steven got even more desperate.
        
        “Are you saying that I should just let Steey attempt suicide? Besides, I can’t die. Now, will you excuse me,” Steey shuffled past them, his grip tightening the obsidian.
        
        “Steve-” Before Celestia could finish, Steven was out of the door, leaving a trail of silence in his tracks.
        
        Where are you Steey?
        Steey was busy finding ev
        300words on him going to the boss. 
        End part midway when Steven was attacked at first. Say how he saw many people trying to fight but then just saw a red river. (red river is a metaphor of the abrupt blood shed)
        
        Possible ending: He tumbled and tumbled 
        
        …
        
        Ra-tat-tat
        
        On the door, a knock caught all of them from their thoughts. In the kitchen, Elijah is still arguing with Luxury, while Celestia is full-on depressed in the corner with Calista’s constant attempts to cheer her. 
        
        Mr Narb slowly approached a broken piece of wood that had been laying solace beside the stairs. His eyes stare at the unexpected knockings while his fingers curve around the wood, gripping it tightly.
        
        They each moved into position with a feeling of threat, picking up whatever they could reach, and moving to wherever they felt comfortable as close to them as they could.
        
        Bang! The door was forcefully swung open, and behind it was a couple of men in black uniforms, each with similar physiques. On their hands lay a deadly weapon, one that everyone knows to keep from messing with.
        
        “Get down!” The soldier on the front said imperatively. Their full-on commanding vibe made Mr Narb immediately drop his stick. They were not messing around with those guns.
        
        Just as they were about to surrender themselves to the empire, a beam of laser cut through the soldier’s hand. As the rest of them turned to witness the direction of the commotion, their reaction was cut short as they were shot unconscious from the gun behind.
        
        “Frick this, I am on your side now.” Noah groaned as he kicked a fallen soldier off from the entrance. As Noah’s eyes contracted with Elijah, a heavy red sight was fixated between them. Elijah’s expression remained unchanged, but his mind was all tripped and tangled. As he quickly tried to re-organise his crumbled mind, his mind just put out an error to him. After a few seconds of intense stare, Elijah just can’t repuzzle his thinking. So eventually, he spurted out a single yet abrupt word.
        
        “What?” he splurted out.

        Song that basically explains The first arc of part 2 (Chapter 1, 2, 3) (AI generated)
        
        
        In the mountains of Nepal, Steey Neilanamai, 
        A boy with a past, a story to convey, 
        His dad wrongly jailed, fate's cruel design, 
        Released but later on, his parents' light decline.
        
        
        (Pre-Chorus) He met a girl, same age, hearts collide, 
        Their love so pure, destiny they tried, 
        But danger loomed, shadows pursued, 
        Their lives entwined, dreams subdued.
        
        
        (Chorus) Steey fought the bad, 
        defend with pride, Lost his folks, wounds open wide, 
        Blaming her for all, 
        not knowing the pain, Emotion scars, a lifelong chain.
        
        
        (Verse 2) They dug to china To China they fled, seeking refuge's grace, 
        Hoping to save all, in a new embrace, 
        Tragedy struck, their world askew, 
        In darkness they walked, souls withdrew.
        
        
        (Bridge) Steey turned away, from the girl he knew, 
        Regrets and tears, his heart withdrew, 
        Twist of fate, her life met its end, 
        His pain intensified, wounds won't mend.
        
        
        (Verse 3) In China's grasp, he found a friend, 
        Blakay, a soul, a helping hand extend, 
        Apocalypse came, the dead walked the earth, 
        Survival they sought, for all it was worth.
        
        
        (Chorus) Amidst chaos, they fought the night, 
        Blakay turned, Steey's heart took flight,
        Friends departed, blame was cast, 
        Steey stood alone, shadows amassed.
        
        
        (Verse 4) In shadows he trained, his might defined, 
        Facing bullies, battles he'd bind,
        Caught in the battle royale, a world of disdain, 
        For orphans like him, a relentless terrain.
        
        
        (Outro) Steey fought and endured, four years on the way, Steely determination, his will in full display, 
        In a cruel world, seeking redemption, Steey Neilanamai, a name of ascension.
