    <h2>Top New Zealand Travel Tips</h2>
        
        <h3>
        1. Don’t Try to Do Everything</h3>
        <p>New Zealand may be a small country but there is so much to see and do. Not to mention all the incredible landscapes to explore across two main islands. If you’re thinking you can see it all, you’re going to be disappointed or overwhelmed trying.  My best tip for new visitors to New Zealand is “don’t try to do everything”. 

        Even living here for many years, I still haven’t done it all.

        No matter how much time you have, it’s impossible to do absolutely everything. And that’s ok! Plan a realistic itinerary so you can take the time to enjoy it. Prioritize your absolute must-dos, then build additional things around that.

        Road trips are a good way to see a lot of things in between two main cities, including the small towns and beautiful landscapes around New Zealand.

        </p><h3>2. Plan According to the Season</h3><p>
        New Zealand is split across two main islands, and they are different in both terrain and climate. Research the areas you plan to visit including the weather to help you determine the best time to visit New Zealand.

        In winter it can be quite cold in the South Island which may restrict certain activities, but it is ideal for skiing and snowboarding in the parts which have an alpine environment.

        In summer it is a busier time to visit but there are more options with the good weather such as beach activities, especially in the warmer North Island. 

        Spring and fall can be good for hiking and experiencing popular activities with fewer crowds.

        If you are planning road trips, bear in mind there can be snow and ice on roads in the alpine areas during winter. So you’ll need to keep an eye on road conditions and may need to consider a 4WD or carrying snow chains for your vehicle.

        Tips for traveling in New Zealand.
    </p><h3>3. The Seasons are Reversed</h3><p>
        Speaking of planning according to the season, it’s worth mentioning our seasons are opposite to the Northern Hemisphere. 

        Summer in New Zealand runs from December to February and winter from June to August. 

        This means summer school holidays are in December and January, which combined with the holiday season tends to be the busiest time of year to travel around New Zealand. Be sure to check school calendars if you want to avoid the school holiday crowds.

        Spring (September to November) and fall (March to May) are considered the shoulder seasons and tend to be less busy with cheaper prices for accommodation, car rentals and some attractions than you would find in peak season.

    </p><h3>4. Rent a Car or Campervan</h3><p>
        Public transport outside the main cities is limited. If you plan on exploring multiple areas, I recommend renting a car or campervan. It offers the most flexibility and you can explore the country at your own pace.

        Even within the cities, you may be limited to what you can see and do without your own transport. For example, the west coast beaches in Auckland are worth visiting but you’ll need a car to get there.

        Hotels in the cities generally charge a fee for parking and it can be expensive. An option is to build your itinerary so that you have a few days in the city first without a car, then rent a car for the day trips you plan to take later on.

        There are several car rental companies in New Zealand, including international brands and local companies. Some of the popular companies include Budget, Avis, Hertz, and Europcar. It’s important to do your research and compare prices and services before making a reservation.

        We like using DiscoverCars.com to compare prices and book our rental cars. Once you enter your travel details they search the best deals you!

    </p><h3>5. Know All Your Transport Options</h3><p>
        Choosing the best way to travel around New Zealand is a personal choice. If renting a car is not right for you, there are several other options for getting around, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The best option depends on your budget, travel style, and timeframe.

        Here are some options to consider:

        Public transportation: New Zealand has a network of Intercity buses and trains that connect major cities and towns. This is a convenient and affordable option for getting around, especially if you’re traveling on a budget, but bear in mind it takes longer and offers less flexibility.
        Domestic flights: Air New Zealand and Jetstar are the two domestic airlines in New Zealand. Air New Zealand has the most coverage in regional airports, and Jetstar is generally cheaper. Flying between cities is good if you are short on time but it can be expensive and you’ll be limited to airport locations and flight schedules.
        Guided tours: There are bus tours covering most areas of the country from a couple of days to a couple of weeks. It’s a stress-free way to travel, with your itinerary and bookings made for you, and a great way to learn about the areas you visit from knowledgeable guides. Although they can be expensive and you may have limited time to explore on your own.
    </p><h3>6. Know Where You Can and Cannot Camp</h3><p>
        If you plan to explore New Zealand on a budget, staying in campsites and holiday parks along your journey, and renting a campervan is the way to go.  Just be sure to know where you are allowed to camp as you can’t just park up anywhere in New Zealand. 

        Each region has its own by laws on freedom camping that you’ll need to adhere to. And you’ll need to be driving a certified self-contained campervan.

        It’s also a good idea to book where you’ll be staying in advance, especially in peak season.

    </p><h3>7. Learn New Zealand Road Rules</h3><p>
        New Zealand drives on the left side of the road which may be different from what you are used to. This means the steering wheel will be on the right side of the car. A good tip to remember is the driver is always on the side of the car that is closest to the middle of the road. 

        Take some time to practice in a quiet place before tackling the cities or winding mountain roads.

        Things like roundabouts and one-lane bridges are common in New Zealand but may be new to you. Be sure to know the New Zealand road rules and check driving conditions before heading off. 

        You can check the rules for driving as a visitor to New Zealand on the NZTA site, including license requirements.

    </p><h3>8. Explore the Cities</h3><p>
        New Zealand has several vibrant and dynamic cities that offer a range of experiences for visitors. I recommend that you don’t just stick to one during your visit. Each has its own vibe and attractions. They are also a great start and end point for exploring beyond the cities or embarking on a road trip. 

        Auckland, the largest city in New Zealand, is known for its stunning harbor, world-class restaurants, and has plenty of attractions to choose from. Being a main travel hub, many visitors spend at least one day in Auckland to start their trip.
        Wellington, the capital city, is a cultural hub with a thriving arts scene, great coffee, and beautiful harbor views. 
        Christchurch, located on the South Island, is known for its beautiful gardens and parks as well as cafes and restaurants. 
        Queenstown, the adventure capital of New Zealand, offers a range of outdoor activities, from skiing and snowboarding to bungee jumping, skydiving and jetboating. 
        These cities, among others, offer a unique glimpse into New Zealand’s culture and history, as well as plenty of exciting things to do – rain or shine.

    </p><h3>9. Explore Beyond the Cities</h3><p>
        New Zealand is known for its natural beauty and there are many ways to experience it. From scenic drives and world-renowned hiking trails to national parks and quaint towns rich in history and culture. 

        In fact, New Zealand is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Areas, two International Dark Sky Reserves/Sanctuaries and 13 national parks that are free to visit.

        Each area offers unique landscapes and activities, so try to visit at least a couple during your trip. Nature is what New Zealand does best!

    </p><h3>10. Respect the Environment</h3><p>
        New Zealand has a commitment to caring for the environment, including conservation efforts to preserve the native wildlife that is under threat due to invasive species.  

        Tiaki is a significant part of Māori culture that can be loosely translated to mean to care, conserve and protect. The Tiaki Promise is a commitment to care for New Zealand and everyone who lives and travels here has a responsibility to look after it. This means that while traveling in New Zealand we will:

        Care for land, sea and nature, treading lightly and leaving no trace
        Travel safely, showing care and consideration for all
        Respect culture, traveling with an open heart and mind
        It’s important to stay on marked trails and practice “leave no trace” principles when hiking and camping. Always leave with anything you brought. Leaving trash or tramping on delicate vegetation is not responsible or respectful.

        Be sure to clean your boots at cleaning stations when you see them. Not all trails have them, but it is an important step in containing diseases such as Kauri tree dieback, which is killing our beautiful Kauri trees. So please use them when you see them. 

        This is why it’s also important to only bring clean hiking gear into New Zealand. Declare your gear at the airport and they’ll even clean it for you.

    </p><h3>11. Try Local Cuisine</h3><p>
        New Zealand may not be the first place that comes to mind when thinking about food, but thanks to its diverse cultures and rich agricultural resources New Zealand has a range of delicious foods to try. Be sure to try local cuisine and visit farmers’ markets for fresh produce. Here are some of the best local dishes and where to try them:

        Auckland: Known for its multicultural food scene. Visit the Auckland Night Markets to try a variety of street food from all over the world. Head to Commercial Bay for a selection of restaurants and an upmarket food hall with a range of eateries. Or head to the Viaduct for Auckland’s top restaurants with a view. Try the steak and oysters at Oyster and Chop or fresh seafood at Soul Bar and Bistro.
        Rotorua: Experience a hāngī meal and learn about Māori culture at a Māori Village in Rotorua. Hāngī is a traditional method of cooking in Māori culture in which food is steamed in an underground pit, referred to as an earth oven, resulting in deliciously tender meat and root vegetable infused with smoky flavors.
        West Coast: Famous for its whitebait fitters. New Zealand whitebait are tiny fishes with a subtle flavor, most commonly served in fritters. They can be found all over New Zealand during whitebait season (September and October), but especially along the West Coast of the South Island.
        Bluff: A small town located at the very bottom of the South Island known for its fresh seafood and bluff oysters that are wild caught straight off the coast. If you can’t make it to Bluff, don’t worry, they are shipped to just about every seafood restaurant in the country from March to August.
        Kaikoura: Known for its amazing crayfish with ‘seafood caravans’ dotted along the coast. Similar in appearance to lobster but with a subtle flavor. If you’re heading to Kaikoura be sure to stop at Nins Bin to try their famously fresh crayfish.
        Queenstown: Home to the famous Fergburger, arguably New Zealand’s best burger, but also many restaurants featuring farm to table cuisine and local wines. Try Rata restaurant for fresh contemporary New Zealand cuisine. Or the signature ribs at Flame Bar & Grill, we dine here at least once or twice whenever we’re in Queenstown!

    </p><h3>12. Enjoy Local Wine</h3><p>
        New Zealand is known for its world-class wine, with several regions producing some of the best wines in the world. There are quite a few and I’m still working my way through trying them all!

        Try to visit a couple of wineries, tour the vineyards, and sample the wine. It’s a wonderful experience sitting amongst the vineyards.  Enjoy the stunning views of the surrounding landscapes, as well as a chance to meet the winemakers and learn about the wine-making process.

        You may like to book a wine-tasting tour. There are plenty to choose from in each of New Zealand’s wine regions. Here are a few of our favorite wine regions to visit in New Zealand:

        Waiheke Island, located on the North Island and a short ferry ride from Auckland, is known for red wines based on Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Malbec and Cabernet Franc grape varieties. The island is home to 30 boutique wineries, many with tasting rooms, swanky restaurants and breathtaking views.
        Hawke’s Bay, located on the North Island, is known for its full-bodied red wines, including Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah. 
        Marlborough, located on the South Island, is known for its Sauvignon Blanc, which is crisp, refreshing, and bursting with tropical fruit flavors. 
        Central Otago, also located on the South Island, is known for its Pinot Noir, which is elegant, complex, and has a distinct earthy flavor. 
        Popular wineries include Cloudy Bay in Marlborough, Craggy Range in Hawke’s Bay, and Felton Road in Central Otago.

    </p><h3>13. Book in Advance</h3><p>
        New Zealand is a popular destination during the summer months (December to March). Accommodation and tours can fill up quickly. Many visitors from the Northern Hemisphere come to escape their winter plus local families are traveling for summer school holidays. 

        It’s worth booking your accommodation and car or campervan rental well in advance for the best rates. As appealing as it sounds to arrive with a road trip plan and wing it on where to stay each night, it’s not a good idea. 

        Even campsites need to be booked in most places and you may end up with nowhere to stay if you leave it to the last minute. You’re better off having a rough itinerary and booking your accommodation in advance for each area. 

        I also recommend booking any tours or attractions you don’t want to miss out on.

        If you’re traveling between May and October you’ll have more flexibility with fewer crowds. With the exception of  Queenstown, which gets busy for ski season from June to August. Even then, you’re better off having a rough plan with flexible bookings that you can change around once you’re here.

        The South Island offers some of the most scenic drives in the country with views that have to be seen to be believed. Our 2-week South Island road trip itinerary provides a comprehensive loop around the island stopping at popular attractions and off-the-beaten-path locations.

        The Southern Scenic Route follows the coastline from Dunedin to Invercargill including picturesque lighthouses and stunning waterfalls to be explored along the way.

        You can continue on the Southern Scenic Route from Invercargill to Te Anau through the remote coastal communities and popular surf beaches along the southern coast.

        Te Anau is a great base from which to explore the popular Milford Sound and the more remote Doubtful Sound. The drive from Te Anau to Milford Sound is an incredible journey through the lush landscapes of Fiordland with plenty of scenic stops along the way and not to be missed.

        But my personal favorite is the drive from Queenstown to Mt Cook. Plan for a slow drive, with plenty of stops to see all the best views and places to discover along the way. From New Zealand’s oldest hotel to landscapes that can only be described as otherworldly, it has it all.

        Here are some other scenic drives you might enjoy:

    </p><h3>15. Protect Yourself from the Sun and Sandflies</h3><p>
        The UV rays are pretty intense in New Zealand, thanks to a thin ozone layer and less airborne pollution to scatter the UV radiation. Traveling in New Zealand requires some preparation to protect yourself from the sun’s harmful rays all year round, with extra precautions during the summer months. Here are some of our top tips:

        Check the UV Index: UV levels are variable across the country and depending on the time of year. The sun’s rays are generally the strongest from months of September to April and from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. so make sure you can seek shade during these times and plan outdoor activities in ways that prevent overexposure to the sun.
        Sunscreen: Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with at least SPF 30 and remember to re-apply regularly, even if it’s cloudy. Consider a waterproof sunscreen if you’ll be swimming or sweating and re-apply more often.
        Clothing: Wear lightweight, long-sleeved shirts and pants to protect yourself from prolonged exposure to the sun. You can find apparel with built-in UV protection, but generally clothes with a tight weave are best at blocking UV rays.
        Hats and Sunglasses: Protect your face, neck and shoulders with a wide-brimmed hat. Sunglasses that block both UVA and UVB rays are best for protecting your eyes.
        Hydrate: Exposure to the sun can bring on dehydration quickly, especially when you’re active. Drink plenty of water, even if you don’t feel thirsty, to ensure you stay hydrated.
        Bring Bug Spray: Sandflies can be prolific in areas near running water and humid bush such as beaches, lakes and waterfalls, especially during summer. These tiny insects leave an itchy bite that can be unpleasant.  Cover your arms and legs with clothing and use a high deet insect repellent if venturing to these areas. I also find they don’t bother you as much if you keep moving.
