    <h3>The cuisine of New Zealand is largely driven by local ingredients<br> and seasonal variations. As an island nation with a primarily agricultural economy,<br> New Zealand yields produce from land and sea. Similar to the cuisine of Australia, the<br> cuisine of New Zealand is a diverse British-based cuisine, with Mediterranean<br> and Pacific Rim influences as the country has become more cosmopolitan. Historical influences <br>came from British cuisine and MƒÅori culture. Since the 1970s,<br> new cuisines such as New American cuisine, Southeast Asian, East Asian, and South Asian have <br>become popular.</h3>
