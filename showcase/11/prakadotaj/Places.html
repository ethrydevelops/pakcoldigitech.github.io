    <h3>New Zealand (Māori: Aotearoa [aɔˈtɛaɾɔa]) is an island country in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.<br> It consists of two main landmasses—the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui) and the South Island (Te Waipounamu)—and over 700<br> smaller islands. It is the sixth-largest island country by area and lies east of Australia across the Tasman Sea <br>and south of the islands of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. The country's varied topography and sharp mountain <br>peaks, including the Southern Alps, owe much to tectonic uplift and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is<br> Wellington, and its most populous city is Auckland. The islands of New Zealand were the last large habitable land<br> to be settled by humans. Between about 1280 and 1350, Polynesians began to settle in the islands and then <br>subsequently developed a distinctive Māori culture. In 1642, the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman became the first <br>European to sight and record New Zealand. In 1769 the British explorer Captain James Cook became the first European <br><br>to set foot on and map New Zealand. In 1840, representatives of the United Kingdom and Māori chiefs <br>signed the Treaty of Waitangi, which in its English version declared British sovereignty over the islands. In 1841,<br> New Zealand became a colony within the British Empire. Subsequently, a series of conflicts between the colonial <br>government and Māori tribes resulted in the alienation and confiscation of large amounts of Māori land. New Zealand became <br>a dominion in 1907; it gained full statutory independence in 1947, retaining the monarch as head of state. Today, the majority<br> of New Zealand's population of 5.25 million is of European descent; the indigenous Māori are the largest minority, followed by Asians <br>and Pasifika. Reflecting this, New Zealand's culture is mainly derived from Māori and early British settlers, with recent <br>broadening of culture arising from increased immigration. The official languages are English, Māori, and New<br> Zealand Sign Language,with the local dialect<br> of English being dominant.</h3>
    
    <h2>Cathedral Cove</h2>
    
    <h3>Also called Te Whanganui-A-Hei Marine Reserve, Cathedral Cove is touted as one of the<br> best places to see in New Zealand. Located on the North Island, its isolated position on the Coromandel<br> Peninsula adds to its irresistible appeal.</h3>

    <h3>Explore an enchanting world of secret gardens. Transport yourself <br>through time and to far-flung corners of the world. Meander through a lush tropical jungle,<br> visit ancient China and indulge yourself in a Renaissance Prince's 16th century <br>garden. Five garden collections have been created to delight the senses,<br> with some garden concepts reaching back 4,000 years. Hamilton Gardens is a<br> conceptual garden based in the Waikato that explores the context, <br>history and meaning of gardens through time, and from around the world. It is<br> internationally recognised for its unique concept and is the Waikato region's most<br> popular tourist destination.

Access is off SH1, alongside Cobham Drive on <br>the southern side of Hamilton.</h3>
