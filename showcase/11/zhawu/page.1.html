    <p>"Genshin Impact" is an action role-playing game developed by miHoYo.
    It was launched on Microsoft Windows, Android, iOS, and PlayStation
    4 in September 2020, and will be launched on PlayStation 5 in April 2021.
    The game has an anime-style open world environment and adopts game modes
    of free play and in-app purchase of cards.
    The game plot unfolds on the continent of Teyvat in each fictional world.
    This world connects seven countries. Each country is themed around an
    element and is governed by the god of the corresponding element. The
    protagonist of the game's plot is the "Traveler", a brother and sister
    who traveled through countless worlds. They were forced to separate in 
    Teyvat because they were blocked by strange gods. The player will play 
    the role of a survivor, traveling with Paimon across the Seven Kingdoms 
    in order to find his only missing blood relative.
    The game was launched in early 2017 and received
    widespread condemnation after its release in September 2020. Critics 
    praised the game's combat and the immersion brought by the open world,
    but criticized its game upgrade experience and payment model. The 
    original God was also a commercial success, earning over $2.3 billion
    in its first year on the App Store and Google Play alone, making it 
    the highest-grossing video game in its first year.</p>

    <p>"Genshin Impact" is an open-world action role-playing game [1]. Players
    can choose four characters to participate in the battle at a time, and 
    can quickly switch during the battle [2]. Characters can enhance their 
    powers in various ways, such as increasing the character's level and 
    improving the relics and weapons equipped by the character[3]. In addition
    to exploration, players can also try various challenges to earn rewards.
    The world is littered with bosses and challenges that reward high-value resources but consume stamina that slowly regenerates over time[4]. Completing these challenges allows players to progress towards higher adventure levels, unlocking new quests, challenges, and increasing world levels[5]. World level is a measure of how powerful the enemies in the world are and how rare the rewards for defeating them are.[6]</p>

    <p>The game uses an open world map. In addition to normal walking, players can explore various ruins and terrains through climbing, swimming, gliding and other mobile methods. Players can interact with many set interactive parts in the world. For example, players can encounter fires that can be used for cooking in the wild and cook on them. Sometimes the fires they encounter are extinguished and need to Players must use the fire element to manually ignite it before cooking. The lit fire will also be extinguished when it comes into contact with the water element. Some characters have abilities that can alter the environment, such as freezing water to create an icy path that can help players traverse watery terrain. There are many teleport points in the world that allow players to fast travel, and some teleport points can also heal and restore characters, and provide benefits such as increasing the player's stamina. Food and ores can be obtained from the open world, while enemies and treasure chests drop other types of resources that can be used to enhance the character's strength. In addition, there are some special battle spaces called "secret realms" that will also reward materials that enhance the strength of characters and weapons. Players can obtain food by hunting animals, gathering fruits and vegetables, or purchasing food from stores. Cooked food can restore a character's health or improve various properties. Players can also obtain ores that can be refined and used to create or enhance weapons.</p>

    <p>Each character has two skills: elemental combat skills and elemental burst. Elemental combat skills can be activated as soon as the cooldown time of the move expires. Elemental burst requires a certain amount of elemental energy to be accumulated before it can be released. The character can control one of the seven natural elements: ice, grass, fire, water, wind, thunder, and rock. These elements can interact in different ways, and switching characters during combat and performing these skills allows these elemental interactions to occur. Certain elemental abilities may be required to solve puzzles in the overworld.</p>
