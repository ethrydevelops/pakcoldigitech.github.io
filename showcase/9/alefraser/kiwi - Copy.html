    <h2>What Is Cricket </h2>

    <p>
        Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams 
        of eleven players on a field at the centre of which is a 22-yard 
        (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising 
        two bails balanced on three stumps. Two players from the batting 
        team (the striker and nonstriker) stand in front of either wicket, 
        with one player from the fielding team (the bowler) bowling the 
        ball towards the striker's wicket from the opposite end of the 
        pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball and then switch 
        places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run 
        for each exchange. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches or 
        crosses the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled

        <h2> The Formats Of Cricket </h2>

    <p>
        There are three formats of cricket played at the international 
        level – Test matches, One-Day Internationals and Twenty20 Internationals. 
        These matches are played under the rules and regulations approved by the 
        International Cricket Council, which also provides match officials for them.
    </p>
    <p>
        Test cricket is the traditional form of the game, which has been played since 
        1877 and now settled in a five-day format which comprises two innings each. 
        It is considered the pinnacle form because it tests teams over a longer period 
        of time. Teams need to exhibit endurance, technique and temperament in different 
        conditions to do well in this format.
    </P>
    <p>
        One Day Internationals, also known as ODIs, are a pacier format which started 
        in 1971 but gained in popularity from the 1980s. These are one-innings matches 
        of 50 overs per side, in which teams with a blend of technique, speed and skill 
        are expected to do well. The ICC’s pinnacle event, the ICC Cricket World Cup, is 
        contested every four years in this format.
    </P>
    <p>
        Twenty20 Internationals are the newest, shortest and fastest form of the game. 
        This format of 20 overs per side has brought in new audiences since its advent 
        in 2005 and also triggered new skill sets and innovations. A Twenty20 International 
        match is usually competed in three hours and with huge hitting, skillful bowling and 
        amazing fielding it has been hugely popular with fans right around the world.

    <h2> World Test Championship </h2>

    <p>
        The first tournament began with the 2019 Ashes series. In March 2020, matches 
        were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, not resuming before July 2020, 
        with several rounds of matches being postponed or ultimately cancelled. 
        New Zealand became the first team to qualify for the final, when it was 
        confirmed that the series between South Africa and Australia would not proceed,
        [19] followed by India. The inaugural World Test Championship Final was played 
        between India and New Zealand from 18 to 23 June 2021 at Rose Bowl, Southampton, 
        England.[20] Despite the opening and fourth day of the final being washed out by 
        rain,[21] New Zealand managed to win in the final session of the reserve day and 
        lifted the first World Test Championship trophy.[22]
