    <h2>About the show</h2>

    <p>
    The Queen's Gambit is a 2020 American coming of age period drama television mini series 
    based on the 1983 novel of the same name by Walter Tevis. The title of the show refers to a chess opening called "Queen's Gambit". 
    The story follows the life of Beth Harmon, a fictional american chess prodigy on her rise to the top of the chess world
    while stuggling with drug and alchohol dependency. The Queen's Gambit follows the life of an orphan chess prodigy, Elizabeth Harmon,
     during her quest to become an elite chess player while struggling with emotional problems, drugs and alcohol dependency. 
     The title of the series refers to a chess opening of the same name. The story is set in the mid-1950s and 1960s.

    In the 1950s in Lexington, Kentucky, an eight-year-old Beth, having lost her mother in a car crash, is taken to an orphanage where she is taught chess by the building's custodian, 
    Mr. Shaibel. As was common at the time, the orphanage dispenses daily tranquilizer pills to the girls to "balance their disposition", which turns into an addiction for Beth.
     She quickly becomes a strong chess player due to her visualization skills. A few years later, Beth is adopted by childless suburban couple Alma and Allston Wheatley. 
     As she adjusts to her new home, Beth enters a chess tournament and wins despite having no prior experience in competitive chess. Alma is initially resistant to Beth's interest in chess, 
     but after Beth wins her first tournament, Alma is fully supportive of her adoptive daughter's sojourns to enter various chess competitions. Beth develops friendships with several people, 
     including former Kentucky State Champion Harry Beltik, United States National Champion Benny Watts, and journalist and fellow player D.L. Townes.
    As Beth rises to the top of the chess world and reaps the financial benefits of her success, her drug and alcohol dependency worsens. 
    With help from her oldest friend Jolene, whom she grew up with in the orphanage, she prepares for a major international chess tournament against the world's best players in Moscow.

    <h2> The origins of the game of chess</h2>

    <p>
     Chess first appeared in India about the 6th century CE.
    By the 10th century it had spread from Asia to the Middle East and Europe.
     Some regard the game chaturanga to be the precursor of
     modern chess because of the different piece abilities and the win 
     condition being the capture of a singular piece (king).
