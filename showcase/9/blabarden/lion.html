<h2>Features</h2>

<p class="subheading">something about lions.

<p>The lion is a well-muscled cat with a long body, large head,
     and short legs. Size and appearance vary considerably between the sexes.
      The maleâ€™s outstanding characteristic is his mane, which varies between
       different individuals and populations. It may be entirely lacking; it 
       may fringe the face; or it may be full and shaggy, covering the back
        of the head, neck, and shoulders and continuing onto the throat and 
        chest to join a fringe along the belly. In some lions the mane and
         fringe are very dark, almost black, 
    giving the cat a majestic appearance. </p>

<h2>Lion Prides</h2>

<p>Lions are unique among cats in that they live in a group, or pride. 
    The members of a pride typically spend the day in several scattered groups
     that may unite to hunt or share a meal. A pride consists of several 
     generations of lionesses, some of which are related, a smaller number 
     of breeding males, and their cubs. The group may consist of as few as 
     4 or as many as 37 members, but about 15 is the average size. Each pride 
     has a well-defined territory consisting of a core area that is strictly
      defended against intruding lions and a fringe area where some overlap 
      is tolerated. 
    Where prey is abundant,</p>

<h2>Hunting</h2>

<p>Lions prey on a large variety of animals ranging in size from rodents 
    and baboons to Cape (or African) buffalo and hippopotamuses, but they
     predominantly hunt medium- to large-sized hoofed animals such as 
     wildebeests, zebras, and antelopes. Prey preferences vary geographically 
     as well as between neighbouring prides. Lions are known to take elephants 
     and giraffes, but only if the individual is young or especially sick. 
     They readily eat any meat they can find, including carrion and fresh kills
      that they scavenge or forcefully steal from hyenas, cheetahs,
     or wild dogs.</p>
