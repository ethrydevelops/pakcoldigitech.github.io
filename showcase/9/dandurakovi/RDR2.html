    <h2>about the game</h2>
<p>
    Red Dead Redemption 2[a] is a 2018 action-adventure game developed and published by Rockstar Games. The game is the third entry in the Red Dead series and a prequel to the 2010 game Red Dead Redemption. The story is set in a fictionalized representation of the United States in 1899 and follows the exploits of Arthur Morgan, an outlaw and member of the Van der Linde gang, who must deal with the decline of the Wild West while attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries. The game is presented through first- and third-person perspectives, and the player may freely roam in its interactive open world. Gameplay elements include shootouts, robberies, hunting, horseback riding, interacting with non-player characters, and maintaining the character's honor rating through moral choices and deeds. A bounty system governs the response of law enforcement and bounty hunters to crimes committed by the player.

<h2>Lore before the epilouge</h2>
<p>
    Before Arthur heads back to camp to confront Micah, he tells the women to leave for safety, bidding them farewell. Arthur arrives at the camp telling Dutch that Micah is the Pinkertons informant with the latter denying it. This initiates a standoff between Arthur and Micah. John unexpectedly appears telling Dutch he left him to die. Arthur tells everyone to pick their side and the gang is dissolved with Susan and John siding with him. Javier announces that Pinkertons have arrived which distracted Susan allowing Micah to fatally shoot her. Dutch draws his guns and tells everyone who is ''with him'' and ''betraying him''. Bill, Javier, Micah, Joe, and Cleet joins Dutch's side against John and Arthur. Before anything could happen, Pinkertons led by Edgar Ross launch an assault on Beaver Hollow, but all six manage to flee into the wilderness. Arthur accepts his fate and either buys John time to escape by confronting the Pinkertons, or heads back to camp to retrieve Dutch's money stash. After either option, Micah ambushes Arthur and Dutch intervenes in their fight. Arthur convinces Dutch to leave Micah with the latter telling him to join him and get the Blackwater money. Dutch abandons both men and Micah angrily leaves. If played honorably, Arthur succumbs to his tuberculosis and injuries and peacefully dies facing the sunrise with a Buck basking under the sun. If played dishonorably, Micah executes him with his revolver and in place of the buck, the player will see a Coyote under the rain.
<h3>epilouge</h3>
<p>
    After arriving at Micah's camp, Charles and Sadie are wounded by his men, forcing John to continue alone. After gunning down several of Micah's men, including Joe, John confronts Micah and Sadie corners him. Dutch unexpectedly appears, having reunited with Micah to recover the stashed Blackwater money. Micah then takes Sadie hostage and initiates a Mexican standoff between the three. After an exchange of words, where Dutch accuses John of betraying the gang during their final days, Dutch shoots Micah for betraying the gang, Micah drops Sadie and tries to kill both of them but John manages to end Micah for good. With Micah dead, John tries to thank Dutch but he leaves without saying a word. John then takes the money that Micah and Dutch had since recovered from Blackwater, and uses it to fully pay off his loan. Later, John formally marries Abigail, and they both look forward to living a new life on their ranch, alongside Uncle and Jack, while Charles and Sadie leave to pursue their own futures.
