<h1 class="robot">The creation of Mechs and it's problems</h1>

<p class="mechanics">
The creations of Giant robot suits have been something we've all imagined
before. Maybe you thought about having a robot servent, maybe you played
a video game that cool robot battles, or maybe you were worrying about the robot apocalypse.
Pretty much, we've all wondered about robots. What I was thinking was "how 
do we make mechs/robots" Well there are a few problems with making the. So 
I'm here to bring you problems in the hope you might have the idea to fix them.
</p>

<h2 class="Gpt"> Resources/power </h2>

<p class="mechanics">
    The main problem is the amount of resources it would take to make them. Imagine if there were millions of giant mechs roaming the earth. Imagine if they were all 10ft tall and 6ft wide. We would run out of resources before I could say 'mechanical'; we'd all be poor. No more new buildings, no more jewelry, no more consoles; we'd be screwed. Then there's the power issue. What happens when they require more power than your bloody house? You can't use nuclear energy, as the radiation would turn the owners into husks. And what happens when the mech takes too much damage? Personally, I don't want my house becoming the next Hiroshima (No disrespect). Plus, if we can't use nuclear energy, then what can we use? No one wants their mechs having mini turbines poking out of them. And what of the costs?!?
</p>

<h2 class="Gpt">Systems</h2>

<p class="mechanics">
    Now it gets worse. I don't think it would be all too easy to create a system to control each part of the mech. I mean, buttons would be hard to manage, as it would be like this: 'Press the red button to walk and the blue one to punch. Don't press yellow; yellow kills us all.' Fighting would be impossible, as it wouldn't be prepared for the situations you could encounter. The same applies to controllers. Joysticks would be a hundred times worse. A VR-like system wouldn't work, as you would need years of military training to fight, and as we all know, wearing a VR headset for too long makes you sick. Then, even if you found a way to control it well, you would now need to make it agile. You need to be able to move like we do. You'd have to sit, crouch, bend over, and turn like we can. This is going to be extremely hard, but possible.

<h2 class="Gpt"> Society</h2>
<p class="mechanics">
    Now our true problem, the problem in every video game with mechs is... how they're used. Like in video games, if we got our hands on mechs, we would use them for one thing: WAR. Countries would quite literally take war and worsen it. Now, as a civilian in a war, you might be able to kill someone attacking you, but you would now be attacked by a giant robot five times your size. Even if we stopped ourselves from using them in war, we'd still use them as if we were in that one RoboCop movie. 'News flash: giant robot police misidentifies child as a threat and turns him into a new soup flavor.' And the worst part would be what civilian society would think. 'I think these robots are bad news.' 'I think that they will take over the world.' And we all know what would happen if AI took over the world.
