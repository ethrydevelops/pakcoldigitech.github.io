    <h2 class="K-pop">About the Genre</h2>

    <p>
        K-pop (Korean: 케이팝; RR: keipap), short for Korean popular music, is a form of popular music originating in South Korea as part of South Korean culture.
        It includes styles and genres from around the world, such as pop, hip hop, R&B, rock, jazz, gospel, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, disco,
        and classical on top of its traditional Korean music roots.
        The term "K-pop" became popular in the 2000s, especially in the international context. 
        The Korean term for domestic pop music is gayo (가요; 歌謠), which is still widely used within South Korea.
        While "K-pop" can refer to all popular music or pop music from South Korea, 
        it is colloquially often used in a narrower sense for any Korean music and artists associated with the entertainment and idol industry in the country, regardless of the genre.

    <h2 class="K-pop">Modern K-pop</h2>

    <p>
        Modern K-pop "idol" culture began in the 1990s, as K-pop idol music grew into a subculture that amassed enormous fandoms of teenagers and young adults.
        After a slump in early idol music, from 2003, 
        TVXQ and BoA started a new generation of K-pop idols that broke the music genre into the neighboring Japanese market and continue to popularize K-pop internationally today.
        With the advent of online social networking services and South Korean TV shows, the current spread of K-pop and South Korean entertainment,
        known as the Korean Wave, is seen not only in East Asia, but also throughout the world, gaining an international audience.

    <h2 class="K-pop">Idol Trainee</h2>

    <p>
        The mainstream method is to become an idol trainee through agency auditions, online auditions, or street casting.

        South Korean management agencies offer binding contracts to potential artists, sometimes at a young age.
        Trainees live together in a regulated environment and spend many hours a day learning how to sing, dance, speak foreign languages, and gain other skills in preparation for their debut.
        This "robotic" system of training is often criticized by Western media outlets.
        In 2012, The Wall Street Journal reported that the cost of training one Korean idol under SM Entertainment averaged US$3 million.
