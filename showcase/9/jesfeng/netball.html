    Netball is a ball sport game played on a 
    rectangular court by two teams of seven players.
    The primary objective is to shoot a ball through 
    the defender's goal ring while preventing the 
    opposing team from shooting through their own goal ring.

    <h2 class="netball">Objective</h2>

    <p class="netball">
    The objective of netball is to score more points than your opposition. This is achieved by 
    scoring goals through the nets positioned at either end of the court. You get one point for
    every goal you score.
    </p>

    <h2 class="netball">Match start and restart</h2>

    <p class="netball">
    The match starts with a centre pass, which is taken by the Centre in the centre circle. Other than the opposing Centre, 
    all players must start in either their defensive or attacking goal third, defending on their position e.g. a Goal Defence 
    must start the match in their defensive goal third.When the umpire blows the whistle to signify the start of play, the Centre
    will attempt to pass the ball to a teammate. The ball must be caught in the centre third. If a player receives the ball in the 
    goal third without it being touched in the centre third, the other team is awarded a free pass.After a goal is scored, players
    return to their starting positions and another centre pass is taken. The teams take alternate centre passes, regardless of which 
    team has just scored.
    </p>

    <h2 class="netball">Footwork and passing the ball</h2>

   <p class="netball">
    When a player in is possession of the ball, in accordance with the netball rules, they must pass to a teammate or
    shoot within 3 seconds. If they fail to do this, the ball goes to the other team for a free pass. This is referred
    to as a held ball. Players are also not allowed to throw the ball from one goal third to the other goal third without
    it being touched in the centre third. This results in a free pass for the other team.As well as the three-second rule,
    players aren’t allowed to replant their landing foot if they choose to raise it from the ground. This means that they 
    can take one step with their free leg and raise their landing foot off the ground, however they must pass the ball or
    shoot before their foot touches the ground again. Players are also able to pivot with their free foot to manoeuvre into
    a better passing position. The other team gets a free pass if a player replants their landing foot. This is referred to as footwork.
    <p>

    <h2 class="netball">Shooting</h2>

   <p class="netball">
    Goal Attack (GA) and Goal Shooter (GS) are the only players allowed to shoot and score goals. Shots must be taken within the shooting circle
    sometimes referred to as the D or semi-circle. The ball must pass through the net from above for a goal to be awarded. When a goal is awarded, 
    play restarts with a centre pass.
   </p>

   <h2 class="netball">Obstruction and contact</h2>

   <p class="netball">
    According to netball rules, the sport is not strictly a non-contact sport, however contact is only allowed when not impeding an opponent or general play.
    When a player is in possession of the ball, their opponent must stand at least three feet away from them when marking. If the player is impeded, 
    an obstruction is called and the offending player must stand ‘out of play’ while a penalty pass or shot is taken.
    A player can decide to carry on with their pass or shot while being obstructed by their opponent if they think they will gain an advantage. 
    If they complete a successful pass or shot, the umpire will play advantage and play will continue. If the pass/shot is unsuccessful, 
    the umpire will stop play and bring it back for a penalty pass or shot.
