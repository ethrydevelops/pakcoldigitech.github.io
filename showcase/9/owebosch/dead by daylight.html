<h2>what is dead by daylight?</h2>

<p>
    Dead by Daylight is an online asymmetric multiplayer survival 
    horror video game developed and published by Canadian studio
    Behaviour Interactive. It is a one-versus-four game in which
    one player takes on the role of a Killer and the other four 
    play as Survivors;[a] the Killer must hunt and impale each 
    Survivor on sacrificial hooks to appease a malevolent force 
    known as the Entity, while the Survivors have to avoid being
    caught and power up the exit gates by working together to 
    fix five generators.
</p>

<h2>Perks</h2>

<p>
    Survivors and Killers each have the option to use up to 
    four perks in their loadout, which gives their characters 
    special abilities. Perks differ between Survivors and Killers;
    a Survivor perk may not be used by Killers and vice versa. 
    Examples of Survivor perks include a burst of speed when running
    from the Killer, the ability to self-heal without a med-kit, 
    briefly sabotaging sacrificial hooks without a toolbox, and many
    more. Examples of Killer perks include seeing Survivors through
    walls, hindering the effects of struggling Survivors while taking
    them to a hook, preventing generators from being worked on, regressing
    generators, speeding up the recovery from a missed basic attack,
    and many more.

<h2>killer</H2>

 <p>
    When hunting Survivors, the Killer must capture them by 
    either striking them with their weapon twice and picking
    them up off the ground while they are in the dying state
    (one strike injures Survivors and a second strikes puts them into the dying state)
    or by grabbing them in one move by catching them unexpectedly while they interact
    with objects such as generators. Although Survivors can attempt to pull themselves
    free of the hook the first time they are impaled, there is only a 3% chance of 
    success and failed attempts lead to a faster death. They can also be saved by other Survivors.
    If they are hooked a second time, they enter a phase in which they must resist the Entity as it
    attempts to take them out of the game by performing skill checks until they are either killed or rescued.
    If they are hooked a third time, they will be sacrificed to the Entity.       
    </p>


<h2>Survivor</h2>

<p>
    The Survivors' movement options consist of sprinting, walking, crouch-walking, or crawling if they are in the dying state. 
    They must elude the Killer by losing their line of sight in a chase or by successfully hiding from them. Most Killers can 
    move at a pace that is moderately faster than that of a sprinting Survivor but are slower in other movements, such as vaulting
     obstacles, which can buy Survivors time. Survivors can throw down wooden pallets placed at key locations on the map, and if the
     Killer is close enough to the pallet when the Survivor throws it down, they will be stunned for a brief moment.
     
    The Survivor
    can then vault over the downed pallet, but most Killers cannot, and must either spend time to break the pallet or go around it.
    The Killer also has an aura-reading ability, constantly revealing the location of generators, hooks, and sometimes Survivors. Every Killer has
    their own unique power that can be altered using add-ons obtained through gameplay.
    A significant amount of the gameplay revolves around chases, with Survivors using 
    their environment and wits to outmanoeuvre the Killer and escape them or at least
    buy time for their allies to complete objectives.
