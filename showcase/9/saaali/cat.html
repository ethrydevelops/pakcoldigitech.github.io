        <h2>Domestication</h2>

        <p>
        Cats have been domesticated for thousands of years.
        They were initially valued for their ability to hunt pests like rodents,
        making them valuable assets to early human settlements.
        </p>

        <h2>Anatomy</h2>

        <p>
        Cats are known for their agility, flexibility, and sharp senses.
        They have retractable claws, keen eyesight (especially in low light),
        excellent hearing, and a highly developed sense of smell.
        </p>

        <h2>Behavior</h2>

        <p>
        Cats are known for their independent nature.
        They are often seen as solitary animals,
        but they can form strong bonds with their human caregivers and other pets.
        They have a wide range of vocalizations, including meowing, purring, hissing,
        and chirping, which they use to communicate with humans and other cats.
        </p>

        <h2>Grooming</h2>

        <p>
        Cats are meticulous groomers and spend a significant amount
        of time each day grooming themselves.
        This behavior helps them regulate their body temperature, remove loose fur,
        and keep their coats clean.
        </p>

        <h2>Sleeping habits</h2>

        <p>
        Cats are crepuscular animals,
        which means they are most active during dawn and dusk.
        They spend a large portion of their day sleeping, often in short bursts.
        On average, cats sleep for around 12-16 hours a day.

        <h2>Breeds</h2>

        <p>
        There are numerous cat breeds
        each with its own unique characteristics in terms of appearance,
        temperament, and health. Some popular breeds include the Persian,
        Siamese, Maine Coon, Bengal, and Scottish Fold.
        </p>

        <h2>Health</h2>

        <p>
        Like all pets, cats require proper care and attention to stay healthy.
        This includes regular veterinary check-ups, vaccinations, parasite control,
        and a balanced diet. Common health issues in cats include dental problems,
        obesity, urinary tract issues, and respiratory infections.
