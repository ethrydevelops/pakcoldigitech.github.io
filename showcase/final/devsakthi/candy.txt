<p>When you sell lollies for a living you get to know what the best sellers are and what Kiwis just can’t get enough of. Kiwi expats pay some ridiculous shipping fees to get their favourite NZ lollies shipped all over the world, just so they can bring back the taste of home that they love and miss…</p>

<p>We thought we’d share with everybody what the most popular lollies are that we sell. There may be some lollies that aren’t on the list, and maybe you don’t agree with the rankings, but it is what it is… our take!</p>

<p>Most of these are old school lollies that have been around since the 80s and 90s. The classic Kiwi lollies we used to buy in a 20-cent mixture from the corner dairy (back when you could get several lollies for 20 cents!).</p>

<p>Jumping right in at the top of the list…</p>
