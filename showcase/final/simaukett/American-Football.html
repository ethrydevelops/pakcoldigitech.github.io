    <h2>Baseball Cards</h2>
    <div class="Cards">
        <p> Baseball cards have been a popular collectible item for decades, with their origins dating back to the late
            19th century. They typically feature images of baseball players along with statistics and biographical
            information on the reverse side. Baseball cards have evolved significantly over the years, both in terms of
            design and value. </p>

        <p>Here are some key points about baseball cards: </p>

        <p> Historical Significance: Baseball cards have a rich history, starting from the late 1800s when tobacco
            companies began inserting them into cigarette packs as a marketing strategy. These early cards are highly
            sought after by collectors and can fetch enormous sums at auctions. </p>

        <p> Manufacturers: Several companies have produced baseball cards over the years, including Topps, Bowman,
            Fleer, Upper Deck, and Donruss. Topps is one of the oldest and most well-known manufacturers, dominating the
            market for much of its history. </p>

        <p> Rookie Cards: Rookie cards, which depict a player in their first year of professional play, are often the
            most valuable cards in a player's collection. The rarity and condition of these cards heavily influence
            their value. </p>

        <p> Condition: The condition of a baseball card significantly impacts its value. Cards that are well-preserved,
            with sharp corners, no creases, and vibrant colors, are highly desirable to collectors. </p>

        <p> Grading: Professional grading services, such as PSA (Professional Sports Authenticator) and Beckett Grading
            Services (BGS), assess the condition of cards and assign them a grade on a scale from 1 to 10. Higher graded
            cards generally command higher prices. </p>

        <p> Investment: Some collectors view baseball cards as an investment opportunity, hoping that their value will
            appreciate over time. However, the market can be volatile, and not all cards increase in value. </p>

        <p>Modern Cards: While vintage cards from the early 20th century remain highly sought after, modern cards also
            have a dedicated following. Companies continue to produce new sets featuring current players, special
            inserts, autographs, and game-used memorabilia. </p>

        <p> Collecting Culture: Baseball card collecting has a vibrant community, with enthusiasts trading cards,
            attending conventions, and participating in online forums to discuss the hobby. </p>

        <p>Overall, baseball cards hold both sentimental and monetary value for collectors, serving as a tangible
            connection to the sport's history and its iconic players. </p>

    <h2>Basic Rules:</h2>

    <div class="Rules">
        <p> Scoring: Teams score points by advancing the ball into the opposing team's end zone for a touchdown (worth
            six
            points), kicking the ball through the opponent's goalposts for a field goal (worth three points), or scoring
            a
            safety (worth two points) by tackling an opponent in their own end zone.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Rules">
        <p> Downs and Yards: A team has four downs, or attempts, to advance the ball at least ten yards. If they
            succeed, they
            receive another set of four downs. If they fail, possession of the ball is turned over to the opposing team.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Rules">
        <p>Positions: American football teams consist of offense, defense, and special teams units. Each unit has
            specific
            roles and responsibilities, with players assigned to positions such as quarterback, running back, wide
            receiver,
            lineman, linebacker, cornerback, and safety.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="Rules">
        <p> Clock Management: The game is divided into four quarters, each lasting 15 minutes (though actual gameplay
            can extend
            well beyond this due to stoppages). Teams can call timeouts to stop the game clock, and the clock stops
            after
            certain events such as incomplete passes and players going out of bounds.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="Rules">
        <p> Penalties: Penalties are called for infractions such as holding, pass interference, and offsides. Penalties
            can
            result in the loss of yards or automatic first downs for the opposing team, depending on the severity of the
            infraction.</p>
