         <h2>Features</h2>
        <p class="subheading">The dog is one of the most common household pets found around the world.</p>
            <p> Dogs are loyal and <i>social animals</i>, renowned for their strong bonds with humans. They have a keen sense of smell, which is significantly more developed than that of humans, and excellent hearing that allows them to detect sounds from long distances. Dogs come in a wide variety of breeds, each with distinct physical characteristics, from size and coat type to temperament and energy levels. Their behavior is often shaped by their breed's specific traits, such as herding, guarding, or retrieving. Dogs are highly trainable and thrive on interaction and activity, making them affectionate and protective companions.</p>
            <h2>Senses</h2> 
        <p> Dogs possess extraordinary senses that make them exceptional companions and working animals. Their sense of smell is particularly remarkable, with up to 300 million olfactory receptors in their noses, compared to about 6 million in humans, enabling them to detect scents over vast distances and distinguish subtle differences. Their hearing is also highly sensitive, capable of picking up frequencies ranging from 40 Hz to 60,000 Hz, far beyond the human range. This acute hearing allows them to hear sounds from great distances and detect high-pitched noises. While their vision is less developed than their other senses, dogs can see well in low light conditions and have a wide field of view. These heightened senses make dogs adept at tasks like tracking, hunting, and providing assistance to humans.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Dogs have been companions to humans for thousands of years, with their domestication tracing back around 15,000 to 30,000 years ago. Initially, wolves began to scavenge near human settlements, and over time, a mutual relationship developed. Early humans found these animals useful for hunting, protection, and companionship. Through selective breeding, various dog breeds were developed to perform specific tasks, such as herding, guarding, and retrieving. Over centuries, dogs evolved from working animals to beloved pets, valued for their loyalty, affection, and unique bond with humans.</p>
        <h2>Senses</h2> 
        <p>Dogs have highly developed senses that make them remarkable companions and effective workers in various roles. Their sense of smell is particularly extraordinary, with up to 300 million olfactory receptors in their noses compared to about 6 million in humans. This allows them to detect scents at incredibly low concentrations, making them invaluable in search and rescue, detection of explosives, and medical alert roles. Their hearing is also acute, capable of detecting a wider range of frequencies than humans, which helps them sense sounds from much further away. Additionally, dogs have good night vision due to a higher number of rod cells in their retinas, enabling them to see better in low light conditions. These heightened senses contribute to their ability to navigate, hunt, and communicate effectively in their environments.</p>
