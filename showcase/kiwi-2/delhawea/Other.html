                <h2>What is it</h2>

                <p>
                Along with many other things but with the introduction of the internet new things have began affecting others espcially for the last few years, the internet has began to advance in many ways especially social media wise. The term "Main Character Syndrome" was formed on the internet as a way to describe a person who acts or belives that they themsevles are the protagonist or "Main Character" in their life. They tend to belive that just like in a movie everything around them is or is meant to be centered around them
                </p>

                <p>
                Because of this mindset it can come off very arrogant and rude towards other people. Such as an instance where a man or woman walk into a coffee shop with a phone or a camera recording, under the guise that they are an infulencer or they are making a video or a social media post. Now that in itself is not an issue unless the establishment has a rule against recording while on the premises, but if that is also not the case and it's because of the person with the phone such a reason could be because the were discourteous against other paitrons, employees or both. Main character syndrome is when they are fragrantly being arrogant because they either believe that because of their social media background or tha everything really does need to be cattered to them in every way.
