<h1>The Shimaenaga</h1>

<p class="subheading">Japan's cute bird.</p>

<div class="main">

<h2>Features</h2>

<p>Shima-Enaga is one of my favorite birds on our planet, and they are a 
sweetheart looking “Bonnie of a Bird,” and they have a uniquely all-white 
face and is a sub-species of the long-tailed bushtit. The Shima-Enaga occur 
mostly in Hokkaido, Japan. But they inhabit the entire Paleatrictic realm. 
The long-tailed tit is sometimes referred to as the silver-throated tit or 
silver-throated dasher. The long-tailed tit was first classified as a 
tit of the Parus group. The Parus has been split from the Aegithalidae 
nd becoming a distinct family containing three sub-group families.</p>



<h2>Eggs</h2>

<p> Long-tailed Tits typically lay a single clutch of eggs in March and April
in a beautifully intricate domed nest, constructed of lichen and cobwebs,
and lined with up to 1,500 feathers. This species has a co-operative breeding 
strategy, with younger birds helping breeding pairs to rear chicks. Males and 
females look alike</p>
