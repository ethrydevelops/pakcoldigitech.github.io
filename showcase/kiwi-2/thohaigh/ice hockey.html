    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
        Ice hockey is a thrilling, 
        fast-paced sport that combines skill, 
        strategy, and physicality on the frozen rink. 
        Players maneuver a small, hard puck with sticks while skating at 
        high speeds, aiming to score goals against opposing teams. 
        The game is characterized by its rapid transitions between offense and defense, 
        with players often engaging in body checks and strategic plays to gain an edge. 
        The intensity of ice hockey is heightened by its frequent fights, quick line changes, 
        and the need for precise teamwork and communication. With its blend of agility, strength, 
        and tactical prowess, ice hockey captivates fans with its high-energy action and 
        unpredictable outcomes.
