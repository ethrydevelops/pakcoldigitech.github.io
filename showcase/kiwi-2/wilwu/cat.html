    <p class="subheading">Fascinating Facts About Our Feline Friends</p>

    <div class="main">

        <h2>Features</h2>

        <p>Cats are known for their agility and grace. They have retractable claws, which they use for climbing, hunting, and self-defense. Their keen sense of hearing and sharp vision make them excellent predators, while their flexible spine allows them to leap great distances and twist their bodies mid-air. A cat's whiskers are highly sensitive and help them navigate their surroundings.</p>

        <h2>Senses</h2>

        <p>Cats have an extraordinary sense of smell, which is about 14 times stronger than that of humans. Their hearing is also remarkable, allowing them to detect high-frequency sounds that are inaudible to humans. This makes them adept at hearing the faintest rustles and sounds, which is crucial for hunting. Their eyes are adapted for low-light vision, giving them superior night vision.</p>

        <h2>Behavior</h2>

        <p>Cats are known for their independent nature, but they also display a range of social behaviors. They communicate through vocalizations, body language, and scent marking. A cat's purring is often a sign of contentment, though it can also indicate pain or distress in certain situations. Grooming is an important part of a cat's routine, helping them to stay clean and manage stress.</p>

        <h2>Breeds</h2>
