    <h1>The Philippine eagle</h1>

    <p class="subheading">Philippine national bird.</p>

    <div class="main">

        <h2>Features</h2>

        <p>
            The eagle has a dark face and a creamy-brown nape and crown. 
            The back of the Philippine eagle is dark brown,
             while the underside and underwings are white. 
             The heavy legs are yellow, with large, powerful, dark claws, 
             and the prominent, large, high-arched, deep beak is a bluish-gray.


            Philippine eagles are found on four of the more than 6,000 islands 
            in the Philippines: Luzon, Samar, Leyte, and Mindanao. 
            Their preferred habitats include primary forests
              in the lowlands and at mid-elevation, much of which 
              has been cleared for development and logging, 
              driving many eagles farther into the mountains

        <h2>What they do</h2>

        <p>
            Philippine Eagles, like all top predators, 
            play a very important role in their environment. 
            They are what is known as an umbrella species. 
            Just as several people can stand under one large umbrella
            and be protected from the rain, so too can many species of wildlife 
            be protected by conserving one species like the Philippine Eagle. 
            To protect the eagles, we must protect the monkeys and civets 
            and other animals they need for food, the plants and animals 
            that monkeys and civets feed on, and the trees that Philippine Eagles 
            nest in, which helps protect the other animals that use these trees 
            for food, shelter, and space. Conserving Philippine Eagles 
            and their habitat automatically provides protection for all 
            the other plants and animals that live there too.
        </p>

        <h2>Eggs</h2>

        <p>
            Philippine Eagles construct huge stick nests that they build high 
            in the main fork of a tree, often on a platform of ferns and orchids. 
            Every other year, the female lays one large white egg, which must be 
            incubated for about 2 months. When the chick hatches, it looks like 
            a big-headed, big-footed ball of cotton. During the first several weeks,
             the chick cannot thermoregulate, or control its own body temperature.
             Both the male and the female take turns protecting their young 
             from rain or sun, heat or cold.
