<h1>The Dog</h1>
<p class="subheading">It is cultivated in many parts of the world.</p>

<div>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>
The dog is a mammal with sharp teeth, an excellent sense of smell, 
and a fine sense of hearing. Each of its four legs ends in a foot,
or paw, with five toes. Each toe has a soft pad and a claw. A coat 
of hair keeps the dog warm.
</p>

<h2>Senses</h2>
<p>
The sense of smell is your dog's most acutely sharpened sense. 
Dogs can smell better than humans, and they use it much more widely.
</p>

<h2>babie</h2>
<p>
Most puppies are born head first but some come tail first. 
Puppies are born inside a thin sac, which the mother will 
remove, enabling them to breathe. After each puppy, your 
dog should pass an afterbirth (placenta), which they often eat.

    <li>Move slowly</li>
    <li>Don' make eye contact for long.Because that would signal a fight</li>
    <li>Wait for the dog to aproach</li>
