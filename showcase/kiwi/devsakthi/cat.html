<h1>The Cat</h1>

      <h2>Appearance</h2>

      <p>The domestic cat has a long and powerfully built body. Males are about 28 inches (71 centimeters) long. Females are about 20 inches (51 centimeters) long. Large eyes help the cat to see well at night. Its triangular ears can turn quickly toward the source of a sound. Four rows of stiff whiskers grow on each side of the nose. These give the cat a delicate sense of touch.</p>

       <p> A cats fur may be black, white, brown, gray, yellow, red, or orange. It may also be striped (tabby); a mixture of white, black, and yellow (tortoiseshell); or marked with patches of color (calico). Cats use their rough tongues to comb and to clean their fur.</p>
        
        <p>There are many breeds of domestic cat. Cats of the same breed have a similar length of hair and other similar features. Most breeds—for example, the Abyssinian, the American Shorthair, and the Siamese—have short hair. Other breeds, including the Persian, have long, thick coats.</p>

      <h2>Habitat</h2>

      <p>Domestic cats live with people in nearly every part of the world. Some domestic cats have no home. These cats, called feral cats, wander freely in many cities.</p>

      <h2>Behavior</h2>

      <p>Domestic cats are carnivores, or meat-eaters. Many hunt and eat small animals, including birds, mice, and rabbits. They use their claws, which they can draw back or in, and their strong, sharp teeth to catch prey. House cats eat mainly canned or dry food made especially for cats.</p>

       <p> The cat is the only animal that makes a sound called a purr. Cats produce purring in their throat. No one knows exactly why cats purr, but it may be a sign of comfort. Cats also make other sounds, including meowing, hissing, yowling, and growling.</p>
