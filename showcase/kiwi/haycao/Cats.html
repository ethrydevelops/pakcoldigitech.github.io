<h1>The Cat</h1>
<h5>A clever subheading</h5>

<div>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>
        The cat it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth,
        and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social
        species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator.
    </p>

    <h2>Senses</h2>
    <p>
        Cat senses are adaptations that allow cats to be highly efficient predators. 
        Cats are good at detecting movement in low light, have an acute sense of hearing and smell, 
        and their sense of touch is enhanced by long whiskers that protrude from their heads 
        and bodies. These senses evolved to allow cats to hunt effectively at dawn and dusk.

    <h2>Eggs</h2>>
    <p>
        Mom will do most of the initial care, but you will need to frequently 
        check on the babies to ensure the mother is caring for them and 
        the kittens appear healthy. A clean, warm, and dry place should be provided 
        for moms and babies. A nesting box is essential for better health and survival.
