<h2>The Chicken</h2>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class="round2">The chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a large and round short-winged bird, domesticated from the red junglefowl of Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for food, providing meat and eggs; others are kept as pets or for cockfighting.

    Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as of 2018, and an annual production of more than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in folklore, religion, and literature..</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class="round2">Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, the legs are unfeathered, and the wings are short.[17] Wild junglefowl can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance.[18] Size and coloration vary widely between breeds.[17] Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under their beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males. Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra feathering under the face, giving the appearance of a beard.[19]</p>

<h2>Origin</h2>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p class="round2">Water or ground-dwelling fowl similar to modern partridges, in the Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens belong to, survived the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that killed all tree-dwelling birds and their dinosaur relatives.[40] Chickens are descended primarily from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and are scientifically classified as the same species.[41] Domesticated chickens freely interbreed with populations of red junglefowl.[41] The domestic chicken has subsequently hybridised with grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl and green junglefowl;[42] a gene for yellow skin, for instance, was incorporated into domestic birds from the grey junglefowl (G. sonneratii).[43] It is estimated that chickens share between 71 and 79% of their genome with red junglefowl.[42]</p>
