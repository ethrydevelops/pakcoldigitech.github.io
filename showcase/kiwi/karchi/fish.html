<h1>The Fish</h1>

<h5>With over over 33000 known species</h5>

<div>
   <h2>About</h2>
   <p>A fish is an aquatic, gill-bearing animal with a hard skull that 
    lacks limbs with digits. This includes hagfish, lampreys, and both 
    cartilaginous and bony fishes. Some 96% of living fish species are 
    teleosts, bony fishes able to protrude their jaws.</p>

    <h2>Features</h2>
    
    Below are some features of fish 
    <ul>
        <li>Cold-blooded vertebrates
        <li>Fins
        <li>Scales
        <li>Gills
        <li>Swim bladders
        <li>Coloration
        <li>Fish are flexible
        <li>Fish breathe
        <li>Scales help fish to swim   
    </ul>
    <p>
        Fish like salmon have gills, are covered in scales, 
        and reproduce by laying eggs. Eels, by contrast, 
        have worm-like bodies and exceedingly slimy skin.

    <h2>Senses</h2>

    <p>
    In addition to taste, smell, sight, hearing, and touch, 
    fish have a unique sensory structure, known as a lateral 
    line, which enables them to sense vibrations in the water. 
    The lateral line is referred to as the sixth sense of fish, 
    and is an extension of their sense of hearing.</p>

    <h2>Eggs</h2>

    <p>
    The methods of reproduction in fishes are varied, 
    but most fishes lay a large number of small eggs, 
    fertilized and scattered outside of the body. 
    The eggs of pelagic fishes usually remain suspended 
    in the open water. Many shore and freshwater fishes 
    lay eggs on the bottom or among plants. Some have adhesive eggs.
