<h1>The Cats</h1>

<h2>About Cats</h2>
<p>
The cat, commonly referred to as the domestic cat or house 
cat, is the only domesticated species in the family Felidae. 
Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown 
that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 
7500 BC.
</p>
<h2>Senses</h2>
<p>
This is all thanks to those sensitive whiskers! Compared to humans, 
cats are nearsighted because their eyes are so large and placed so 
forward on their face. In fact, they can’t focus on anything less 
than 1 foot in front of them. This is where the whiskers come 
into play, as they can swing the whiskers forward to feel in front of them.
However, they make up for this nearsightedness with an excellent ability 
to see in the dark. Cats have extra dark-specializing cells called rods 
and a “reflective mirror” called a tapetum in the back of the eye. 
These work together, so cats can see light at eight times dimmer 
illumination than you can.
</p>
<h2>Territory</h2>
<p>
Cats have tiny scent glands on their feet, and when they scratch furniture 
they leave just a little bit of their smell on it. This tells other cats, 
“This sofa is in my territory, and these are my people—keep away!” Additionally, 
shredded corners of a couch or chair are a visual sign of your cat’s space. 
So although you don’t want your cat destroying your furniture, the scratching 
is a signal that they love you and their space.
</p>
<h2>Species</h2>
<p>
There are around 71 species of cats,
this includes wild cats such as tigers.
Many of the domestic cat species vary by colour,
this includes black, grey, white, brown and orange.
